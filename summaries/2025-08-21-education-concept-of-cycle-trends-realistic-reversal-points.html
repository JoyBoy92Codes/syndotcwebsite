  <h3>TL;DR</h3><ul><li>Um now this this one down here, well that's not a break because it's on the trend, but this one is a break.</li><li>So yeah, that's uh that's all all there is to this little video, but um yeah, uh put something in the comments if that just absolutely blows your mind as to …</li><li>Um because if you are looking for bottoms um on any time frame, if you're trading on a 1 hour, if you're trading on a 4 hour, whatever it might be, this is s…</li></ul>
  <h3>Context</h3><p>So yeah, that's uh that's all all there is to this little video, but um yeah, uh put something in the comments if that just absolutely blows your mind as to how simple a trick that actually is.</p>
  <h3>Key Levels</h3><table style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;margin-top:.5rem">
        <thead><tr><th>Asset</th><th>Level</th><th>Role</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody><tr><td></td><td>265</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>500</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody>
      </table>
  <h3>Setups</h3><p style="color:#9aa3b2">No explicit setups.</p>
  <h3>Takeaways</h3><ul><li>So, um, we're going to run our next trend, which is going to be between the accumulation candle and the accumulation candle there.</li><li>So, uh, we're not going to be able to use that candle for anything, but we are going to be able to run another one, which is from here down to here.</li><li>Um, so if you count the amount of times we're able to relocate a trend, uh, we were able to relocate this one.</li><li>Um the trend will continue to break down until it's had five little breaks to the upside and then sometimes it's six but five to six.</li></ul>
  
  <h3>Notable Details</h3>
  <ul><li>So, uh it's quite clear and easy to do this on high time frames, but it applies to anything because you you'll have 4hour distribution and then 4hour accumulation and that sort of stuff.</li><li>We've actually just hit 265 subscribers today.</li><li>And uh the goal at this stage is to hit 500 and and then we'll probably just raise the bar and try to go higher again.</li></ul>
