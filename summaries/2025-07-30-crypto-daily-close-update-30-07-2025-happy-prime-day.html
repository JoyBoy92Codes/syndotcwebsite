  <h3>TL;DR</h3><ul><li>Um, I think there's still some stuff in play which um should, you know, should definitely go see those 150s um before any kind of major spin around could hap…</li><li>Um if we start to look at the 7-day uh you can see definitely more shorts, less longs and a lot of that is obviously because the longs now um on SOL particul…</li><li>But um for now it can keep diving down if it wants to come down here, hit the hold level and uh that would sort of line up with everything else that's going …</li></ul>
  <h3>Context</h3><p>Um if we start to look at the 7-day uh you can see definitely more shorts, less longs and a lot of that is obviously because the longs now um on SOL particularly a lot of those longs have been taken um just recently u by the the dip.</p>
  <h3>Key Levels</h3><table style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;margin-top:.5rem">
        <thead><tr><th>Asset</th><th>Level</th><th>Role</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>

  <h3>Setups</h3><p style="color:#9aa3b2">No explicit setups.</p>
  <h3>Takeaways</h3><ul><li>So um looking at BTC it'SA little bit little bit more shorts on both BTC and SOL um in the one day have opened up.</li><li>It's ready to be taken. um if it was to go down there, that would that would be a great place for uh them to load up um heavily uh before a push up into into the logs and sell it off and make some money.</li><li>Um, but effectively what's going to happen if we do close under that break level is this break level is going to try to break that trend and then it's going to try to retest the older backside break here which has never had a proper retest since it was broken.</li><li>So um that was the rejection up up here and the first sort of target for that is the trend here at you know it's currently around 160.</li></ul>
  
  <h3>Notable Details</h3>
  <ul><li>Um just recording the daily update for SOL BTC total market cap.</li><li>Um but as you can see BTC is still pretty, you know, pretty even.</li><li>Uh, and then when we look at the 30-day, um, the 30-day is the one that, you know, really says that we've got a bit of a gap here, bit of a gap here.</li><li>Um, but you've got that liquidity all the way down there to that 152, 153 area.</li><li>Um, and uh, maybe even 150.</li><li>Um and you can still see all the way down to sort of around that 110.</li></ul>
