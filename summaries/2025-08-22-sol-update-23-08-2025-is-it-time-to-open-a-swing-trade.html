  <h3>TL;DR</h3><ul><li>Um, and that would be leaving these untested levels down the bottom here, which um is a bit of a ticking time bomb because at some point in the future they g…</li><li>Um I'm looking at this now and thinking that if if people are not in a position um by tomorrow once once we see how this plays out it might be a case of look…</li><li>So, as this goes sideways, it's it's building this liquidity below and above and so we could get that spike up um even up to like that 119 120 and then uh yo…</li></ul>
  <h3>Context</h3><p>Um, and that would be leaving these untested levels down the bottom here, which um is a bit of a ticking time bomb because at some point in the future they get retested and whether that's now or 30 days from now or whatever um they'll end up getting retested.</p>
  <h3>Key Levels</h3><table style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;margin-top:.5rem">
        <thead><tr><th>Asset</th><th>Level</th><th>Role</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody><tr><td></td><td>17</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>18</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>210</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>30</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>191.2</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>187</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody>
      </table>
  <h3>Setups</h3><p style="color:#9aa3b2">No explicit setups.</p>
  <h3>Takeaways</h3><ul><li>Um it's pushed through a couple of high time frame rejection levels from the past and it may be trying to head to the break level um which is sitting up about 210.</li><li>Um closing above some of these really old um high time frame origin levels like from uh back here in the 11th of Feb.</li><li>Um, and we've got a backside area at 191.2, and we've got this uh front side hold level here um at 187.</li><li>Uh if it does do a return to trend um which is also highly possible after it hits 210 that would be this um trend coming through here that candle to that candle.</li></ul>
  
  <h3>Notable Details</h3>
  <ul><li>Um just flick out another update on SOL and what I'm seeing.</li><li>Um SOL BTC strength has hit a very critical point.</li><li>Uh we've got 17 hours or nearly 18 hours on the daily candle to go.</li><li>Um but there is the possibility it closes over this tomorrow and uh if it does that that can be the starting point for a parabolic shift in strength um towards SOL.</li><li>Uh as for the daily daily levels on SOL and just where it's sitting now.</li><li>That would be normal, but it could based on just really a big parabolic shift just bounce straight off the backside of this range trend. it may not even go below 204 and it could just then power up.</li></ul>
