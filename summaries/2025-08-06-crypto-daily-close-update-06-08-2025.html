  <h3>TL;DR</h3><ul><li>They're trying to get people to take out long positions because they've already got pretty decent liquidity um to the upside. the numbers that are sort of sh…</li><li>So, it's still got support, but if it does push up, it's probably from this level, if it does push up, it's really going to at most sort of get to this um 00…</li><li>As it currently stands, it'SA really indecisive um candle, you know, so kind of like a dogee with a bit of a body on it, but it's decent wicks to the upside …</li></ul>
  <h3>Context</h3><p>They're trying to get people to take out long positions because they've already got pretty decent liquidity um to the upside. the numbers that are sort of showing on the one day kind of line up with what I've been thinking uh around that 117 or 117K rejection area for Bitcoin um and into those sort of 170s again um for SOL.</p>
  <h3>Key Levels</h3><table style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;margin-top:.5rem">
        <thead><tr><th>Asset</th><th>Level</th><th>Role</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody><tr><td></td><td>30</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>174</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>185</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>154</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>117</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>162</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody>

  <h3>Setups</h3><p style="color:#9aa3b2">No explicit setups.</p>
  <h3>Takeaways</h3><ul><li>Um, also just a new feature which has just come out on um on coin glass is this one here which gives you the max um max pain.</li><li>II don't think I would use that to place orders because um you know like putting an order at 162 as an example when we've already got structural moves and support sitting at 153 um is probably not best idea but uh as you go through and you you choose the different time frames you'll see that the numbers change.</li><li>Um, and we're starting in a position where if we move up too quickly from here, we just have to come back down, which which sort of um leads to the thought that there is going to be a final liquidity sweep uh when when people least expect it.</li><li>Um however this big work on the top of this candle uh which this is going to shift to there means all we're going to do is we're going to break a trend and we're going to open under another one.</li></ul>
  
  <h3>Notable Details</h3>
  <ul><li>Hey everyone, I'm just bringing you a daily update for SOL BTC market cap.</li><li>It looks like uh 30-day is still bigger to the upside.</li><li>If we look at 7day, uh, 7-day liquidity is starting to even out.</li><li>So, it's showing 174 sort of through to 185 to the upside.</li><li>Um, and anywhere sort of down to about 154.</li><li>And and we've got news um uh I think we've got unemployment claims coming on the ETH.</li></ul>
