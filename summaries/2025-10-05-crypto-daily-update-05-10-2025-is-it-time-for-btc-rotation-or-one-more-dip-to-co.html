  <h3>TL;DR</h3><ul><li>Uh you know 240 is unchanged on the 7-day um when it comes to SOL and down to 203.6 which is an interesting number cuz 204 is the 3month backside um candle a…</li><li>So, this is pretty much now showing that the real hallmarks of the final stage of the bull market where, you know, your altcoins are going to really have the…</li><li>Um, we've got some levels in that 243 area, which might stop us getting there, but, you know, and and if we head to the downside, um, pretty much you can see…</li></ul>
  <h3>Context</h3><p>Uh you know 240 is unchanged on the 7-day um when it comes to SOL and down to 203.6 which is an interesting number cuz 204 is the 3month backside um candle and I just can't help but wonder if we're just going to go down and hit that thing and then fly. there would be some um you know uh up and down in between because we've got you know daily levels and daily holds and stuff like that that pretty much represent all of these price brackets.</p>
  <h3>Key Levels</h3><table style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;margin-top:.5rem">
        <thead><tr><th>Asset</th><th>Level</th><th>Role</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody><tr><td></td><td>127</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>128</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>119</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>120</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>218</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody>
      </table>
  <h3>Setups</h3><p style="color:#9aa3b2">No explicit setups.</p>
  <h3>Takeaways</h3><ul><li>So, you know, now we've got uh some new liquidity brackets up to sort of 127 and nearly 128, which they're all just key levels that, you know, we we know it's going to go to.</li><li>Um as far as SOL goes like the most bullish pullback would sort of just be to that um you know 218 220 uh area and then you know it could easily pump up into the the 240s um based on the daily.</li><li>If we look at the 7-day, uh 7day is where all you know the the juice is on BTC and it's still showing clusters down to sort of that 114 area and some of the high time frame charts show a pullback to 114 um would probably be very realistic um in the coming days.</li><li>So, you know, everything's just going and um yeah, there'SA bit of a tin hat theory behind some of these old zombie coins popping and that's that there's there's all these retail people out there who bought those four, five years ago, 6 years ago, maybe even the cycle before that.</li></ul>
  
  <h3>Notable Details</h3>
  <ul><li>Hey everybody, welcome to your daily update for Solen BTC.</li><li>Uh, we got a 3WE close, 13we close, um, and a one day and a two-day.</li><li>So looking at the uh daily liquidity uh BTC is pretty much just showing what you'd expect.</li><li>And um and it's showing liquidity down to about uh 119 uh 120, which of course would be some of that support that we had closed um yesterday.</li><li>So, that that would be the most bullish sort of pullback you could see is just a pull back maybe to around that 120 area. um which we'll see on the charts and then you know a pump up from there.</li><li>Uh and the same um you know uh 126 127 128 sort of to the upside there is is pretty much um unchanged on the 7-day.</li></ul>
