  <h3>Context</h3><p>Um maybe they push up toxor you knowxI think later is the area we're going to see on the charts that makes a bit of sense andxxaybexum to the top side if they push up on um SOL and then I do think they are probably still going to revisit thexs or or lower.</p>

  <h3>Setups</h3><p style="color:#9aa3b2">No explicit setups.</p>
