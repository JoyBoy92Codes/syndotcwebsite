  <h3>TL;DR</h3><ul><li>Um and certainly it's basically evened out like you you'd think after masses of liquidations people would be very very bullish and um of the price basically …</li><li>And I probably harp on about this a lot, but you know there's if you look at things like X, there's you know thousands of influencers who are trying to give …</li><li>So, you know, I suppose you can look at two different directions, but looking at the the 30-day leverage, uh that 107 area, 108 area still definitely on the …</li></ul>
  <h3>Context</h3><p>Um and certainly it's basically evened out like you you'd think after masses of liquidations people would be very very bullish and um of the price basically only going up up up but uh it appears that just as many people are shorting it as as longing it um SOL the most of the mostly it's just gone very bullish and you know whether that's just this constant narrative about ETF ETF F ETF, ETF.</p>
  <h3>Key Levels</h3><table style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;margin-top:.5rem">
        <thead><tr><th>Asset</th><th>Level</th><th>Role</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody><tr><td></td><td>117</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>210</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>200</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>189</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>253</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody>
      </table>
  <h3>Setups</h3><p style="color:#9aa3b2">No explicit setups.</p>
  <h3>Takeaways</h3><ul><li>Uh, but there is a weekly hold level sitting at 210 uh.6 and there is some weird stuff that just happened this morning on on the bit exchange where there was basically like a one a 1 second or you know sort of spike and it just went straight into that level and rejected which um and then it actually did like a 1 second candle all the way down to 200.</li><li>So, you know, we could close something like the 143day, go up, hit the weekly, dip down to the high time frame um support, take out all these people that are chasing the longs, and then we could bounce up from there.</li><li>And you know, looking at it from a one-day perspective, it just kind of looks like the one day structure just got blown out of the water, but you zoom out and all it's actually saying is, hey, that's just a normal trade.</li><li>Um so there's definitely some to the upside but as you can see still you know the bulk is just um people getting in super bullish basically. uh and then 30-day, you could more or less flush the market in both directions again.</li></ul>
  
  <h3>Notable Details</h3>
  <ul><li>Now, welcome to your daily update for SOL and BTC.</li><li>Um Bitcoin definitely looks like it could go up and hit that 117 area.</li><li>So, uh, yeah, I'd just be watching that 210 level.</li><li>We're also confirming some new really high time frame support today once again at that 189 level.</li><li>So, uh you know, we're never out of the woods when it comes to this. the I was just talking to someone in DMs earlier and the actual like the 11we rejection that took us back to the trend from um 253 the actual bottom of the 11we range is like 120s.</li><li>So you can kind of imagine that in the in the bigger scheme of things at any time the price could be traveling to break the top of the range which is 253 or it could be traveling to retest or break the bottom of the range which is 120.</li></ul>
