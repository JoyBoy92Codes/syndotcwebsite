  <h3>Context</h3><p>Whereas you can see something might be coming for SOL where it's just you know there'SA lot of liquidity up into that 220 and uh there'SA few things that sort of line up with that which I'm seeing um happening actually as we record this um you know to the downside you know 105 again is the featured number um we may not get to 105 on BTC there there is a support level um sitting about 107 that's capable of of sending the price back up.</p>
  <h3>Key Levels</h3><table style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;margin-top:.5rem">
        <thead><tr><th>Asset</th><th>Level</th><th>Role</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody><tr><td></td><td>104</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>105</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>114</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>107</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>110</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>111</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody>
      </table>
  <h3>Setups</h3><p style="color:#9aa3b2">No explicit setups.</p>
  <h3>Takeaways</h3><ul><li>You'd just look at it and think, &quot;Oh, yeah, we just flatlined.&quot; But the areas that are on there are pretty much just uh down to about that 104 105 for the 25x sort of leverage and all the way up to about 114 for the 25x and and the 100x stuff is pretty much uh down to about 107 and and up to about um 110 111 nearly and 50x of course is in the middle.</li><li>Um, it's probably the SOL's probably the more interesting one because it actually seems to be um building a bit of liquidity out to about 212.</li><li>The funny thing is it it wouldn't necessarily be such a big squeeze on um BTC though, like it's still it's out of balance on the 7-day, but really only up to about 115 um maybe even just that 114 area.</li><li>Um now with uh with SOL um there's still a little bit down there at about 188 and there is there is a couple of time frames that show um some possible numbers below 188.</li></ul>
  
  <h3>Notable Details</h3>
  <ul><li>Hey everybody, welcome to your daily update for SOL and BTC.</li><li>Um, it'SA weekend of course, so we've got very much weekend looking liquidity on BTC.</li><li>Um, and then the downside liquidity down to about 193.</li><li>Now, if we have a look at the 7-day, uh 7day is pretty much screaming short squeeze.</li><li>One of the things though about the position that SOL is in right now is that if it closes over about 204.9 or something, we'll get to the exact numbers later, but say around 205, if it closes around 205, there is actually some really big levels that we've never closed a candle over before or not on the same sort of scale anyway.</li><li>And um things like 90-day candles.</li></ul>
