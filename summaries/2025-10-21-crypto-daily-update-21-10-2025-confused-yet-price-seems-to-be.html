  <h3>TL;DR</h3><ul><li>Um, and even if we are, you know, in a final stage of a bull run and and say we're going to go to a blowoff top, it's not uncommon for there just to be these…</li><li>And given it's um capable of a very big rejection, if they've got this huge gap and they want to dump really quickly to make sure that these longs get trappe…</li><li>And you know, SOL has got moves to the upside which go all the way up to 286 just based on um you know, fib levels and uh we've got you know, trends that nee…</li></ul>
  <h3>Context</h3><p>Um, and even if we are, you know, in a final stage of a bull run and and say we're going to go to a blowoff top, it's not uncommon for there just to be these little quick flushes like like what you may have just witnessed if you were watching the charts in in the last few minutes when um sort of almost uh seemingly out of nowhere the the price just um dumped uh and then started to push back up again.</p>
  <h3>Key Levels</h3><table style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;margin-top:.5rem">
        <thead><tr><th>Asset</th><th>Level</th><th>Role</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody><tr><td></td><td>185</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>188</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>204</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>253</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>2021</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>103</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody>
      </table>
  <h3>Setups</h3><p style="color:#9aa3b2">No explicit setups.</p>
  <h3>Takeaways</h3><ul><li>There's uh there'SA little bit more to take to the downside on SOL than there is to the upside, but really it's just you've got almost as many people just uh opening shorts as opening longs.</li><li>Um you know, X is pretty much covered with half people saying it's going to go up forever and the other half of people saying it's, you know, bull run is over.</li><li>It's it's got um the most confluence across a lot of really high time frames and it's capable of of giving one of those huge rejections like like what we saw when we hit 253.</li><li>So, if it doesn't close over um and yeah, the wick the way the wick is when the new trend appears, it'll basically be in a position of resistance straight away and then we could get a rejection back to try and find one of these levels um down the bottom here.</li></ul>
  
  <h3>Notable Details</h3>
  <ul><li>Hey everyone, welcome to your update uh for SOL and BTC.</li><li>Um, so for those that uh sort of layered in below 185 and tpd up into those 188 or 190s, you would have uh you would have at least got something out of yesterday anyway.</li><li>BTC is basically the same.</li><li>So, looking at the 7day chart, yeah, it's pretty even on uh pretty even top side, bottom side on SOL.</li><li>Um II think one of the key levels that we we'll get to in the charts, but one of the key levels just got to keep an eye on is um 204.</li><li>So let's just just keep an eye on that. it would sort of mean that it's taken all of that 7-day liquidity as well.</li></ul>
