  <h3>Context</h3><p>Um hopefully the liquidity on the bottom side of things doesn't build up too much and um the way it's sort of been lately is most of these pauses over the last couple of days are are really just designed to induce people to open up leverage longs so that there's something worthwhile for them to go and liquidate on their way down to where they want to go.</p>
  <h3>Key Levels</h3><table style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;margin-top:.5rem">
        <thead><tr><th>Asset</th><th>Level</th><th>Role</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody><tr><td></td><td>150</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>110</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>163</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>168</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>175</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody>
      </table>
  <h3>Setups</h3><p style="color:#9aa3b2">No explicit setups.</p>
  <h3>Takeaways</h3><ul><li>Um, considering we have got high time frame targets down to here, and we've also got some stuff that's come about today, which um could give us a bit of a rally up into here.</li><li>Um so we may see that weaken. it doesn't mean it can't keep going up and certainly I would expect it to want to come up to this sort of level because that'SA hard close break level and prices sort of just dived all the way through it like that.</li><li>But at this stage, it does look like it's heading up to mark levels that that match up with the liquidity and we got back up over the two-day trend there.</li><li>Um in a bigger like bigger picture wise the monthly move should really get up to 175 as a as a minimum which um lines up with this inverse here on the 2-day.</li></ul>
  
  <h3>Notable Details</h3>
  <ul><li>Uh and as you can see the liquidation levels sort of range down to the 150 area which um or the lower 150 area which is definitely in our targets.</li><li>Um and we're starting to get liquidity down into that 110 area.</li><li>Uh SOL BTC is still bouncing.</li><li>Um back there BTC has bounced off the new daily trend.</li><li>And just another view of SOL, which has bounced off the new daily support trend and seems to be getting up through some of these levels.</li><li>So about 163 168.</li></ul>
