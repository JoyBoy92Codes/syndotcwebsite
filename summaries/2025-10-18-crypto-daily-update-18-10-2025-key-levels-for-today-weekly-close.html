  <h3>TL;DR</h3><ul><li>As far as the 30-day, yeah, 30 days definitely got more to the upside. um a lot of a lot of these really big moves have kicked in on SOL and even just lookin…</li><li>It's not a hard close of the you not a hard close of anything until what whatever whatever comes tomorrow but um still there'SA little bit of hope there that…</li><li>Um, if we have that and we're kind of back up on top of that interior trend and we have a hold level, then we can actually then just bounce off that and head…</li></ul>
  <h3>Context</h3><p>As far as the 30-day, yeah, 30 days definitely got more to the upside. um a lot of a lot of these really big moves have kicked in on SOL and even just looking at the charts again today there's it it's really really easy for BTC just to fall off a cliff right now it's it's sitting in a place that basically is the is the tipping point between losing the entire upper range u which case you know you're going to see 100k or under 100k um or in one more day it could just get uh close up above that level and then basically you're still in the bottom of the top range and then you can go up.</p>
  <h3>Key Levels</h3><table style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;margin-top:.5rem">
        <thead><tr><th>Asset</th><th>Level</th><th>Role</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody><tr><td></td><td>111</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>30</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>170</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>206</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody>
      </table>
  <h3>Setups</h3><p style="color:#9aa3b2">No explicit setups.</p>
  <h3>Takeaways</h3><ul><li>Um, it makes me sort of think though that if it does lose the range, although we're not really showing a lot of liquidity here below u 170 on salt, um the price would almost certainly end up going lower than 170.</li><li>So, um yeah, at this stage it's uh we just don't quite know whether we are in that bare market uh yet or whether we're just in that fake sort of period before it actually finds some excuse to pump to the upside.</li><li>But if we do get a hard close over that, well then it can expand pretty quickly and it can push up into this um this whole next level here, which is something we we haven't really seen that kind of strength um exhibited from SOL since the big pump there in January.</li><li>Um but uh it could, you know, this whole thing could drag out a bit longer if if they end up closing like you see here.</li></ul>
  
  <h3>Notable Details</h3>
  <ul><li>Hey everyone, welcome to your daily update for Solen BTC.</li><li>Um if we have a pump, then you know, maybe we get up to that 111 type area.</li><li>Um and on SOL uh exactly the same thing really.</li><li>The range is pretty much from those low 170s through to um the high or mid to high 190s.</li><li>Um if we have a look at the 7-day positions, then you'd be expecting there to be some kind of short squeeze at some point.</li><li>So, it wouldn't be too hard for them just to push down there and um grab those, you know, 170s, 180s again and then push up.</li></ul>
