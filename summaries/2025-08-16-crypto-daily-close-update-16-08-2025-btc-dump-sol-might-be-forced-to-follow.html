  <h3>TL;DR</h3><ul><li>Uh where the lows would sort of be um short-term lows would would be down to say the 170s and um short-term highs um up to you know about 196 195 sort of area.</li><li>Uh for SOL, um it's showing sort of up to about that 202 area as a cluster for um uh liquidity on the 7day.</li><li>Um, SOL that means pushing up to about 213 uh to take everything to the top side or down to sort of about 163 um to take everything to the bottom side.</li></ul>
  <h3>Context</h3><p>Uh where the lows would sort of be um short-term lows would would be down to say the 170s and um short-term highs um up to you know about 196 195 sort of area.</p>
  <h3>Key Levels</h3><table style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;margin-top:.5rem">
        <thead><tr><th>Asset</th><th>Level</th><th>Role</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody><tr><td></td><td>110</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>115</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>182</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>188</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>192</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody>

  <h3>Setups</h3><p style="color:#9aa3b2">No explicit setups.</p>
  <h3>Takeaways</h3><ul><li>So uh if you use if you uh lose your calendar or smartphone and don't know what day of the week it is, just look at liquidity bars when they get all kind of um spread out and uh very boring looking like this.</li><li>Uh, liquidity on SOL um is the same, although there's uh doesn't quite look as bad as Bitcoin.</li><li>So, as far as the actual levels go, uh, it still sort of shows that we could push into the 120s, um, as far as Bitcoin goes, uh, 115, um, down to 110.</li><li>Um, and then you could see a dive, you know, back down to that 15315 area, which would certainly be a bit of a shock given the um relative strength we've had lately on um SOL.</li></ul>
  
  <h3>Notable Details</h3>
  <ul><li>Um seems a bit early but maybe we are getting very close to uh to the large leverage flush that might get us down to those 110 areas.</li><li>So we we've got a fairly equal amount of longs and shorts uh whether it's SOL or whether it's Bitcoin.</li><li>The SOL one n though looks very much more defined like this.</li><li>Uh 182 being that daily support level.</li><li>Um and that would take you back to sort of where we are now sort of around 188 as a minimum.</li><li>Uh we've got um reasons to go up to 192 which would be things like retesting the 4hour ranges that have been broken.</li></ul>
