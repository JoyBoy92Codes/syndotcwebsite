  <h3>TL;DR</h3><ul><li>Um, personally I feel a little bit uh embarrassed by the fact that I wasn't watching things like four-week charts um on a daily basis and and if you had been…</li><li>So that's um that's what we looking at on the one day. on the 7-day uh you could see that you know pushing pushing SOL up but pushing SOL down would actually…</li><li>Now it's in it's in different hands because some people lost and some people um some people you know gained out of it but the but some of that money that was…</li></ul>
  <h3>Context</h3><p>So that's um that's what we looking at on the one day. on the 7-day uh you could see that you know pushing pushing SOL up but pushing SOL down would actually sorry pushing BTC up pushing SOL down would actually make a bit of sense um even though that makes no sense but you know we have seen that happen before and on 30-day basically it would say well it's now decision time do you do you leave this 107 108 area behind um on BTC and do you just push up and let's let's go visit you know one uh that 124 um resistance and see whether we can overcome that and then do we go to 130s and you know our blowoff top and basically end the end the cycle.</p>
  <h3>Key Levels</h3><table style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;margin-top:.5rem">
        <thead><tr><th>Asset</th><th>Level</th><th>Role</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody><tr><td></td><td>15</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>108</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>170</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>180</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody>
      </table>
  <h3>Setups</h3><p style="color:#9aa3b2">No explicit setups.</p>
  <h3>Takeaways</h3><ul><li>Well, then all that spot gets SOL on the market on the market and there's no buyers for it because it'SA lot of it's sort of not exactly popular tokens and then the next thing you know they're going to zero on exchanges and yeah, it was a pretty um pretty crazy event, but you know, the aftermath of it, it's all very explainable.</li><li>And um I think the the one bullish thing to take out of it is that someone bought it and uh if someone did buy it uh the question then becomes you know do they want to take it up and and from that point you know where do they want to take these profits.</li><li>It's another thing to close below support levels and then have a retest of um something lower, you know, because that just leaves once again uncertainty as to whether we whether or not the price is going to be able to get back up um beyond that uh support which effectively would be resistance if you start closing below it.</li><li>Um now with SOL that's basically saying do we go and revisit the 170 to 180 uh or do we just push all the way through to the 250s and and you know blow off top and end of cycle.</li></ul>
  
  <h3>Notable Details</h3>
  <ul><li>Welcome to your daily update for Solen BTC.</li><li>Um the levels that we hit were all levels that were outstanding and um you know things like 15-day shorts etc. that have been in play for a really long time.</li><li>And those time frames may go back to sort of that 108 retest u on BTC.</li><li>So, as it as it stands on the one day, you you'd sort of say, okay, well, we might get a revisit of 108.</li><li>Um, for SOL, what does that mean?</li><li>It's taken nearly uh 2 hours to prepare these charts today.</li></ul>
