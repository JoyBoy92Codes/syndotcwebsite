  <h3>TL;DR</h3><ul><li>Um, covering off the oddball time frame separately, but just um, going into a little bit more detail on them because um, they're kind of uh, things that peop…</li><li>So they're they're things you can take trades on, but uh they're more useful for confluence because if you start to see a whole bunch of odd ball time frames…</li><li>Now, not only would you make sure you close your short at this point, um you could be risky and just wait to close your short um as a retest of of this hold …</li></ul>
  <h3>Context</h3><p>So they're they're things you can take trades on, but uh they're more useful for confluence because if you start to see a whole bunch of odd ball time frames that actually have confluence with levels that exist on um time frames breaking that are more like the daily, the weekly, the monthly, you know, that kind of stuff, then um then you know that you know these are levels to be taken seriously um one way or the other.</p>
  <h3>Key Levels</h3><table style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;margin-top:.5rem">
        <thead><tr><th>Asset</th><th>Level</th><th>Role</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody><tr><td></td><td>37</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>2021</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>160</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>171</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>43</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody>
      </table>
  <h3>Setups</h3><p style="color:#9aa3b2">No explicit setups.</p>
  <h3>Takeaways</h3><ul><li>So uh based on AA 37-day um time frame um if we have a look at that one comes next cuz ideally you want to get some kind of trend.</li><li>So when it closes under the break level like that, uh you normally know that you're going to get a retest and then a dump or a dump and then a later retest, but that one pretty much went there straight away.</li><li>Um, but because you've tested the hold level, the next accumulation candle is going to be able to go to the break level if it can.</li><li>Um, sometimes you'll get interior ones as well, like you could argue that you're up to four because you've got this slight interior here, but um, say 1 2 3 for now.</li></ul>
  
  <h3>Notable Details</h3>
  <ul><li>So uh this is this is a 37day um I'm just picking this cuz we actually have a 37-day close today.</li><li>Um, and if we rewind all the way back to the beginning of, um, chart here in August of 2021, uh, we're up to our third candle.</li><li>So, so that was basically opening a swing position below 160 and then taking your TP there at 171.</li><li>Then that's sort of when it first hit the trend and that was about $43 and then it started to go down from there.</li><li>So, with this one here, you're going to have a hold level in there at $36.</li><li>Um, when you're down at $36, there isn't really too much of a target for the short because realistically you're getting pretty close to zero.</li></ul>
