  <h3>TL;DR</h3><ul><li>And if we do that, we probably it it really just comes down to whether we close over the top of them um and then head off into, you know, price discovery or …</li><li>So we ran into the backside resistance at several points as the price is going up and that's you know that's kind of like your 217s and 219s and then 220 but…</li><li>Um but yeah, just keep in mind you when you start to see um front side resistance coming in, it usually means that the range is rolling over. um one minute f…</li></ul>
  <h3>Context</h3><p>Um but yeah, just keep in mind you when you start to see um front side resistance coming in, it usually means that the range is rolling over. um one minute front side resistance doesn't really mean much but 15minute frontside resistance will generally create an hourly downtrend and um you know if the hourly downtrend creates the same type of resistance through rejection of a lower high then that will normally create like a 4hour and so on and so forth so it's uh yeah so that's where we are with that so it's probably a bit more education than it was about liquidity um okay so BTC chart so polarity today is um whether or not they close this above or below the hold level here.</p>
  <h3>Key Levels</h3><table style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;margin-top:.5rem">
        <thead><tr><th>Asset</th><th>Level</th><th>Role</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody><tr><td></td><td>17</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>119</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>120</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>105</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>200</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>204</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody>
      </table>
  <h3>Setups</h3><p style="color:#9aa3b2">No explicit setups.</p>
  <h3>Takeaways</h3><ul><li>Uh yeah, so we started pulling back yesterday just before close which um created a bit of a shift in resistance and available support uh and then into the new day we had our first little pullback and then um went straight into some of the structure that they've been creating over the sort of the last week or so and then uh boom up we went into a short squeeze.</li><li>So, um, we've been eyeing up those targets on BTC for, you know, around that one, uh, 17 now for, you know, a few days if if you go back through some of the other videos and we've hit them now.</li><li>So, uh, as it stands, looking at the one day liquidity, um, it it would be quite feasible, um, for them to push up into that sort of, um, the higher 118s, 119, even 120.</li><li>Now the other side of it is that um things like SOL have got some massive trends sitting at about uh 226 and if we close at the right time over the top of that trend it can just moon and you know really really take off um and leave all that other stuff behind.</li></ul>
  
  <h3>Notable Details</h3>
  <ul><li>Hey everybody, welcome to your update for Solomon BTC.</li><li>So, um, so the liquidity I'm sort of looking at on, uh, BTC is still, I know it's kind of disappearing off the chart, but it's still really down to 105.</li><li>Um, so with SOL, not really too sure exactly where that would line up with because it would it would be dependent on the SOL BTC strength which should be able to push up um now.</li><li>Uh, but certainly that 200 area 204 has got some really high time frame um, uh, support in it now and 189 is still the biggest um, block of support area that we have on the chart.</li><li>Uh so all right on the one day we have sorry on the 1 minute liquidity chart here um that 118 level uh on BTC is sort of had its first rejection and at this stage it's not really a big deal.</li><li>Um but it could be a sweep of that 117 resistance that we were talking about recently.</li></ul>
