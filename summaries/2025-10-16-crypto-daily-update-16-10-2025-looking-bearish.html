  <h3>Context</h3><p>Um and BTC uh you know if they were to go down and target that sort ofxxarea again it's still a higher high than um sorry a higher low than where it went to on that previous wick but um yeah going down to those sort of levels there is actually support down there but it's um there is there is also support where we are now and I think the the key thing is that you you want to bounce off it and you don't want to spend time on it or under it because the more time you spend down at the lower prices the more resistance structure actually forms above.</p>
  <h3>Key Levels</h3><table style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;margin-top:.5rem">
        <thead><tr><th>Asset</th><th>Level</th><th>Role</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody><tr><td></td><td>x</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>x</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>x</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>x</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>x</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>x</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody>
      </table>
  <h3>Setups</h3><p style="color:#9aa3b2">No explicit setups.</p>
  <h3>Takeaways</h3><ul><li>Um, you can't generally reverse without some kind of horizontal level to actually um support the price sideways to break the trend.</li><li>Um and the other side of this would be if it rejects down it's probably going to come back down to about thatxarea.</li><li>But um yeah, until one side breaks, it's basically stuck in it's not a very big range either.</li><li>Thisxlevel uh which is now AA support level um which means breaking that break level atx.</li></ul>
  
  <h3>Notable Details</h3>
  <ul><li>Uh, welcome to your daily update for SOL and BTC.</li><li>We'll just we'll keep it quick cuz there is only a one day and ax-day close today uh, which are inxinutes.</li><li>Um, looking at thex-day, then you can see, you know, there is still incentive to come down here to thesexs.</li><li>The thex-day short that kicked in yesterday or the day before has a target of aboutx.</li><li>Once we head into thosexs, we then hit some bigger time frame longs which which actually start they've already started.</li><li>Um so yeah we but we did we did have those low time frame signs last night that we actually have hit that hit those levels and there are further ones that are down more towards aboutx.</li></ul>
