  <h3>TL;DR</h3><ul><li>Um and on BTC probably up to about um 1,900 uh or you know 119 120 maybe but and I suppose liquidity would build as people try to protect their shorts and th…</li><li>So, uh, there'SA slight issue with this, and that's that if it actually opens on the underside of that, which is, um, 1793, it can just reject straight off t…</li><li>Um so you really want to see it just come up a little bit before the end of the day and then it could um at least travel down like even if they're going to g…</li></ul>
  <h3>Context</h3><p>So, uh, there'SA slight issue with this, and that's that if it actually opens on the underside of that, which is, um, 1793, it can just reject straight off the back of it quite violently, and then it will head down to, you know, one of the lower ones, and it could be even down in the sort of um, 16 uh, 16314 sort of area. um because that would be sort of like a an equivalent origin level to match that one.</p>
  <h3>Key Levels</h3><table style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;margin-top:.5rem">
        <thead><tr><th>Asset</th><th>Level</th><th>Role</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody><tr><td></td><td>30</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>105</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>185</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>189</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody>
      </table>
  <h3>Setups</h3><p style="color:#9aa3b2">No explicit setups.</p>
  <h3>Takeaways</h3><ul><li>Um, I think just jumping through the various different uh time frames for liquidity, um, 1 day, 7-day, 30-day, it looks like the key areas, uh, to take is probably going to be about 105, um, and about 185, maybe 189, somewhere in there.</li><li>So, you know, as people start to open these positions, if the intention is to go down and get some lower liquidity and maybe that's where they want to open up AA really big long for a move or maybe they just want to sell close a short or something like that.</li><li>So, um, yeah, it's not not looking like it's reversing at this stage and it doesn't really make sense for it to do it yet.</li><li>Um so if it closes anywhere up in that area, particularly say above 65 67% then it's probably going to go you know straight up to this next weekly retest. uh if it was to pull back in the next 2 hours and get underneath these trends, then that would be much better and it could reject back down and it opened on the underside of the origin level.</li></ul>
  
  <h3>Notable Details</h3>
  <ul><li>Hey everyone, welcome to your daily update for SOL and BTC and uh a few other bits and bobs.</li><li>And, uh, at this stage, that would pretty much wipe out all of the 30-day liquidity.</li><li>Uh as you can see on the 30-day, even if they did AA short squeeze all the way up, they'd be moving up to about 230.</li><li>Um, if we sort of zoom out, look at the SOL one to give you a bit of an idea.</li><li>So, okay, having a look at SOL BTC.</li><li>Whereas this higher level here which um is more like monthly support, this this sort of level at 171 or 170 isn't really an origin level cuz it sort of just got passed through and tested and off.</li></ul>
