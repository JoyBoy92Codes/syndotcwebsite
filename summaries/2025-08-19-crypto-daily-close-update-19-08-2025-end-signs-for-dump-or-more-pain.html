  <h3>TL;DR</h3><ul><li>So there's good good and bad about that. like having a slow grind down enables people to start to open more and more shorts as the price goes down, which whi…</li><li>So, uh, all these all these shorts on BTC, you know, 100x shorts from 113 through to about 116, um, they're just all opening up, you know, on the lower time …</li><li>Um, but it all comes down to where it closes like yesterday. um we get to the SOL charts, you'll note I sent a tweet out yesterday saying if it closes under …</li></ul>
  <h3>Context</h3><p>Um, but it all comes down to where it closes like yesterday. um we get to the SOL charts, you'll note I sent a tweet out yesterday saying if it closes under 185 and you're in a you know profits or a risky position, you need to get out some of it at 185 because we were closing under that break level.</p>
  <h3>Key Levels</h3><table style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;margin-top:.5rem">
        <thead><tr><th>Asset</th><th>Level</th><th>Role</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody><tr><td></td><td>110</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>173</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>180</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>190</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>200</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>112</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody>

  <h3>Setups</h3><p style="color:#9aa3b2">No explicit setups.</p>
  <h3>Takeaways</h3><ul><li>Because the idea if you're going to go low is to go low and then at the final part of it, just wick down through the last liquidity and then quickly pump back up so that everybody who opens along thereafter has to open it back up at a higher level and in in turn the liquidity bands start to push in the upwards direction.</li><li>Um, 30-day liquidity would just show that a wick down anywhere below 110 would pretty much wipe out all the 30-day positions.</li><li>So whether people are capitulating because they're just been in draw down for too long and they think well they're just giving up it's it's possible on the higher time frame.</li><li>Um, just got to remember they can do whatever they want whenever they want if it's economically viable to do it and if there'SA good means of loading up in the in the discount zone and then take it up to the upside and sell it off the same way.</li></ul>
  
  <h3>Notable Details</h3>
  <ul><li>Hey everyone, welcome to your daily update for BTC toll market cap general liquidity.</li><li>1 day liquidity for um BTC is now showing up down to that 110 area.</li><li>Interestingly, SOL hasn't really changed that much.</li><li>Like it's still just that one day liquidity is about the 173.</li><li>Still waiting for these moves up to these sort of 180 levels to play out.</li><li>So yeah, SOL's looking pretty good.</li></ul>
