  <h3>TL;DR</h3><ul><li>To be bullish, you almost want it to go down first just because you want them to leave this big block of um BTC liquidity behind. uh if they just go powering…</li><li>And um, SOL actually SOL's been very bullish. been saying it for a few days now that it's just looked a lot stronger, but it's just kind of come up and it's …</li><li>And that's how you get nice moves that just give continuation is basically candles with small wicks on the top and then open over the top and bounce the next…</li></ul>
  <h3>Context</h3><p>And um, SOL actually SOL's been very bullish. been saying it for a few days now that it's just looked a lot stronger, but it's just kind of come up and it's still got some very dense liquidity up in there and you can see if they if they did push up to that 203 204 area, they've nearly at that point taken everything to the top side.</p>
  <h3>Key Levels</h3><table style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;margin-top:.5rem">
        <thead><tr><th>Asset</th><th>Level</th><th>Role</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody><tr><td></td><td>203</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>204</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>114</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>115</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody>
      </table>
  <h3>Setups</h3><p style="color:#9aa3b2">No explicit setups.</p>
  <h3>Takeaways</h3><ul><li>Um, it is also possible though like from a bullish perspective that we get, you know, get up there in the next 4 hours, close over the top of it and that really changes things, you know, if we can actually start to close, particularly with some of the big weekly closes that we have today.</li><li>Um and you know, that's that's probably the only thing I think that might push it back up a bit further.</li><li>So um yeah bullish would be retracements and then go back up to take the liquidity bearish is sweeps with with candles that end up with big wicks on the top of them and you know big sell downs.</li><li>So if if there's um you know uh sells of positions up into these um up into these short stops or liquidations then once they've SOL they don't want to go higher and buy it back.</li></ul>
  
  <h3>Notable Details</h3>
  <ul><li>Hey everyone, welcome to your daily update for Solomon BTC.</li><li>SOL a little bit different.</li><li>Uh if we were to take all of this, you know, down to the 180s again, that would just basically mean retesting the daily hold.</li><li>Um and that 203 204 area is that area that I've been saying now for the last couple of days.</li><li>So, uh, it's just interesting looking at this that maybe we get a final push up into that, take the 203, 204 and then and then head back down.</li><li>Uh BTC, same sort of thing.</li></ul>
