  <h3>TL;DR</h3><ul><li>Uh likewise uh up there to sort of that 188 area um maybe a little higher uh if they were to push up on SOL and BTC seems to be down to about 115 and up to 1…</li><li>Uh and then then of course it would look extremely imbalanced to the other side and that's when uh those targets down at 150, 150 uh six etc. about all that …</li><li>So, over to SOL. uh one day SOL if it stays where it is in the next um hour and 45 for the next hour and 45 minutes it's going to move um the interior trend …</li></ul>
  <h3>Context</h3><p>Uh and then then of course it would look extremely imbalanced to the other side and that's when uh those targets down at 150, 150 uh six etc. about all that shows up on the screen actually then start to look um like they'd be in scope because you can imagine these lines would uh these sort of waitings as such on on BTC would be down here and then relative that one because the scale changes relative that one would then be really high and um same thing on SOL that would come all the way down and then relative that would be off the charts you know if they if they took all that it would be so out of balance that would just look, which look like it's going to dump big time.</p>
  <h3>Key Levels</h3><table style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;margin-top:.5rem">
        <thead><tr><th>Asset</th><th>Level</th><th>Role</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody><tr><td></td><td>24</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>175</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>188</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>115</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>120</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>121</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody>
      </table>
  <h3>Setups</h3><p style="color:#9aa3b2">No explicit setups.</p>
  <h3>Takeaways</h3><ul><li>Um, so you've got if you really wanted to take all the all that liquidity out on um on the 7-day longs, you'd be taking BTC all the way down to sort of like 111 or lower again and SOL down into the 160s or lower just to uh get rid of it all.</li><li>So if the day ends up closing up, um it actually moves this interior trend up to there and creates resistance, which um isn't necessarily a good thing if you want to actually see it go up to that 16 uh so 163 sort of level.</li><li>Still targeting really um the the six um sort of level for SOL BTC strength and the monthly um hasn't really done too much.</li><li>Um but if it pulls back up inside the break level, then it's it's going to probably try to go back to one of these trends and that might get it back up to that sort of 67% level again, which isn't um going to be as good for risk assets.</li></ul>
  
  <h3>Notable Details</h3>
  <ul><li>Um thought I'd bring you your uh daily update for BTC SOL market cap um liquidity all the other bits and pieces that uh will hopefully lead to us trading in the right direction.</li><li>So there's just as many people right now in the last 24 hours who believe that week is going to be bearish and uh just as many people believing the week is going to be bullish.</li><li>So looks like some pretty good liquidity down there into the uh 170T to 175 sort of area um on for a bit of a quick dip.</li><li>So, that that's when you start to look at it and get a bit concerned about do they do a quick short squeeze then a dump because um it it sort of shows over the last 7 days there's less and less and less shorts coming in and and more and more and more longs.</li><li>You look at 30-day.</li><li>Uh so 30-day is the only one really showing more shorts in play on um BTC and it's the same.</li></ul>
