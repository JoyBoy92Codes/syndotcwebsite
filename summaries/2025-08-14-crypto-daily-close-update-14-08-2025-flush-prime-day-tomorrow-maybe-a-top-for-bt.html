  <h3>TL;DR</h3><ul><li>No real reason to go above 125 as far as um Bitcoin goes. and on SOL uh they're showing up to sort of 213 214 and and right down to that 153 area which um is…</li><li>So yesterday um and today so closing today we only have a 1 day and a two-day close and a 113 day which we will look at but um it's so it's very very similar…</li><li>But um if you enter on one of these and you and you take some profits uh when it hits that sort of 190 area um and then you just set yourself AA stop loss ei…</li></ul>
  <h3>Context</h3><p>So yesterday um and today so closing today we only have a 1 day and a two-day close and a 113 day which we will look at but um it's so it's very very similar to the type of thing that happens when you get um a prime day.</p>
  <h3>Key Levels</h3><table style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;margin-top:.5rem">
        <thead><tr><th>Asset</th><th>Level</th><th>Role</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody><tr><td></td><td>202</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>213</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>182</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>115</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>121</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>125</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody>
      </table>
  <h3>Setups</h3><p style="color:#9aa3b2">No explicit setups.</p>
  <h3>Takeaways</h3><ul><li>Um so to the upside if if they were to bounce uh there is shorts building um up to about 202 uh and then sort of up to about that 213 area in a couple of clusters.</li><li>Um and that has a bit of confluence with something we we'll see when we have a look at the one day charts. uh for Bitcoin that would be very much the same as dropping down to about 115 um if they went down to the bottom.</li><li>Um, and it's not I mean there'SA really big cluster even quite visible on the 7day that goes to that 115 level and that's where there is a bit of confluence with some um potential bounces. um to come.</li><li>Um as for SOL, uh SOL's got quite an obvious cluster up to 203 and then again, same sort of thing up to 213 um for that next cluster. to the downside.</li></ul>
  
  <h3>Notable Details</h3>
  <ul><li>Hi everyone, welcome to your daily update for um SOL, Bitcoin, market cap, uh crypto, etc., etc.</li><li>They've they've gone down and uh swiped pretty much all of those very very overleveraged longs both on BTC and on SOL.</li><li>Um if they want to keep going down they're sort of going to run out of one day liquidity by the time they get down to about 182.</li><li>Um uh and they could easily shoot back up again and sort of take that cluster through to 121 or maybe even higher 125.</li><li>Um, so if we have a look at uh 7day, sentiment for 7day is still basically mixed.</li><li>Um, if you wanted to wipe them out on Bitcoin, you'd sort of be taking all the leverage down to about 114.</li></ul>
