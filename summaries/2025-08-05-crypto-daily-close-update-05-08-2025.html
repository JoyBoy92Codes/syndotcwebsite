  <h3>TL;DR</h3><ul><li>Even though the liquidity just doesn't seem to line up with that at this stage, but um if they did a bit of a pump first and some more longs came in, that wo…</li><li>For now, it's sort of indicating based on where it's closing that it might dive down, grab liquidity, go up, or it might bounce. but it's um uh it's not real…</li><li>So that's sort of implying BTC wants to break down whereas SOL is not creating a hold level on the same time frame at at this stage but unless it was to drop…</li></ul>
  <h3>Context</h3><p>So that's sort of implying BTC wants to break down whereas SOL is not creating a hold level on the same time frame at at this stage but unless it was to drop down um in the next hour andxinutes uh and it's creating that local trend if it goes up a little bit more say say if we can close the day aroundxor higher then it will be really nice um and clearly above that trend.</p>
  <h3>Key Levels</h3><table style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;margin-top:.5rem">
        <thead><tr><th>Asset</th><th>Level</th><th>Role</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody><tr><td></td><td>x</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>x</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>x</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>x</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>x</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody>
      </table>
  <h3>Setups</h3><p style="color:#9aa3b2">No explicit setups.</p>
  <h3>Takeaways</h3><ul><li>Um, so that would be quite bad as far as the pricing, etc. on um on alts, but um but it could also just reject off off the top of that range.</li><li>Um it's sort of opened on the trend, so it's it'SA realx/xum play at the moment for that one.</li><li>So, so yeah, if that opens on the wrong side, rejects off the back side of the trend, which is also about thatxark, um, then yeah, it it would uh be able to come down and you probably wouldn't expect it to bounce until, you know,xat at a at the earliest.</li><li>Um, and at the moment what it's looking like is it's actually looking like it's got a stronger or the the ability to be stronger than BTC in the future because BTC was creating that hold level as well as the trend.</li></ul>
  
  <h3>Notable Details</h3>
  <ul><li>Hey everyone, just bringing you uh today's update for SOL, BTC, crypto market cap, liquidity, and all the uh all the other fun stuff.</li><li>Um, to play out on SOL.</li><li>So, if we look at thex-day, uh, yep.</li><li>So, more bearish over the lastxdays, but as you can see, still plenty of liquidity to take if they were to go down. and they don't usually want those people to be able to stay in the game if they take a leg up.</li><li>So, umx-day a little bit more even, but still more shorts opening up.</li><li>Um, SOL BTC, it's rejected off the interior daily trend.</li></ul>
