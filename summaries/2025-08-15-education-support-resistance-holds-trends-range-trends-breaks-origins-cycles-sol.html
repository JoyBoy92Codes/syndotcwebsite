  <h3>TL;DR</h3><ul><li>Um so you would long support and of course resistance is um something uh exactly the same thing but it's going to be above the current price and uh as price …</li><li>So if you're trading on say a twoe chart like I have sitting here in front of us um well you would be looking for two week support versus two week resistance…</li><li>Um uh there's there's other factors, you know, when when you sort of get more advanced as to how long something can push into um support or resistance before…</li></ul>
  <h3>Context</h3><p>So if you're trading on say a twoe chart like I have sitting here in front of us um well you would be looking for two week support versus two week resistance. and and it is kind of like a versus thing you know because there will be some form of resistance on the two week which is trying to send price to some form of support um and the job of the resistance is to break the support and the job of the support is to try and break the resistance.</p>
  <h3>Key Levels</h3><table style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;margin-top:.5rem">
        <thead><tr><th>Asset</th><th>Level</th><th>Role</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody><tr><td></td><td>2021</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>202</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>50</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody>
      </table>
  <h3>Setups</h3><p style="color:#9aa3b2">No explicit setups.</p>
  <h3>Takeaways</h3><ul><li>Um, so I've had a few questions about this and it's probably for a lot of people who are subscribed um or following me, maybe it'SA bit basic, but for um new people starting out, it's definitely one of the most important things you could ever learn.</li><li>Um so um when it comes to you know support and resistance one of the common questions people often ask is you know which one because there's there's just levels all over the place on charts.</li><li>So it's it's all about the time frame and then of course um when there's multiple resistances um uh which one is going to be stronger?</li><li>Um because you if you're taking AA scalp on a daily support straight into a monthly resistance, you're your daily support's probably not going to beat your monthly resistance.</li></ul>
  
  <h3>Notable Details</h3>
  <ul><li>Um so on a monthly chart back in 2021 uh we created a hold level here with this engulfing candle.</li><li>How things would have played out very differently is that if this candle here had closed in accumulation, particularly back up inside that range, which it could have, then it would target the next resistance being this hold level up here at 202.</li><li>And so it's pretty common to see candles like this open in a state where it's basically 50/50.</li></ul>
