  <h3>TL;DR</h3><ul><li>Um but if we did get some kind of big final flush um over the weekend um this really has the ability to even if it doesn't actually hard close this top one i…</li><li>Um, we're still above the trend, so we could go down, maybe reject down to 113 and then bounce up and take all that liquidity, which which by then there ther…</li><li>It's it's really the the fallover and retest of the trend would start after the hard close of it. um or it would be right towards the end of its time frame t…</li></ul>
  <h3>Context</h3><p>Um but if we did get some kind of big final flush um over the weekend um this really has the ability to even if it doesn't actually hard close this top one it has the ability to hard close the trend um it has the ability say in one more day to still hard close all of these uh this level down here lower down.</p>
  <h3>Key Levels</h3><table style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;margin-top:.5rem">
        <thead><tr><th>Asset</th><th>Level</th><th>Role</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody><tr><td></td><td>23</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>114.2</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>118.5</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>120</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>113</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>119</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody>
      </table>
  <h3>Setups</h3><p style="color:#9aa3b2">No explicit setups.</p>
  <h3>Takeaways</h3><ul><li>So now the question is does it hover around here or does it reject and go further? um if it rejects and goes further, we're going to see the alts sort of pumping even if BTC has weakness, which is um really interesting place to be because that that relates very clearly to what you just saw on the um on the SOL strength chart.</li><li>It's not completely I mean, it's not going to fall off a cliff, but it's um, yeah, it's not really bullish.</li><li>So, this is the this is the time frame that makes me sort of think we're going to go up and um we're probably going to induce some liquidity and then we're going to potentially go up and take those positions that are sort of around that um 118.5 through to 120.</li><li>So, so if this was to sweep the liquidity to the downside here, um do some kind of big push, hit those lower levels that we sort of really want to see hit before we get sustainable continuation, uh within the next 6 days, it could come back up, break the trend and go.</li></ul>
  
  <h3>Notable Details</h3>
  <ul><li>So, uh, just looking at SOL BTC strength, it managed to close um, up over top of the uh, break level on the daily.</li><li>So it could it could go down for 23 hours or whatever, come back up, and if it closes one day and hard closes that level, then it's going to bounce off to the next one.</li><li>Um, which is that little sort of bit of weakness that that we just um have had in the last uh sort of 4 hours.</li><li>So BTC uh never closed above its daily break level.</li><li>So it really had to be over 117500 to get out of this um two candle distribution range.</li><li>Uh, but it did make a hold level down here at 114.2.</li></ul>
