  <h3>Context</h3><p>Uh so, if it does strike there, then that's sometimes a good area that um to take profits on any trades related to SOL. uh if it does end up breaking the break level and closing it, you'll generally get the option of being able to re-enter on the on the break level once it's been hard closed.</p>
  <h3>Key Levels</h3><table style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;margin-top:.5rem">
        <thead><tr><th>Asset</th><th>Level</th><th>Role</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody><tr><td></td><td>17</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>196</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>197</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>112</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>113</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>108</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody>
      </table>
  <h3>Setups</h3><p style="color:#9aa3b2">No explicit setups.</p>
  <h3>Takeaways</h3><ul><li>So, if we're going to go into a weekend and liquidity is quite even um on the one day, then it sort of means that you can end up dumping one direction and then hanging around and building up liquidity and then maybe going back the other way.</li><li>And I don't know if I really like the look of this big area here up to the 112.8 because we know that that's uh there is definitely rejection structure that's sort of built in there.</li><li>Okay, let's have a look at this 30-day 30-day liquidity is a little bit more geared to the upside as far as taking shorts, but it's overall it's pretty even really.</li><li>So um if there is a close uh today if it does happen to sneak down and this this would be quite bullish for alts but if it happens to sneak down below that 66.72 level and open the next candle then you could get a direct rejection off the backside of that level and then a push down which would be that sort of pump uh for alts.</li></ul>
  
  <h3>Notable Details</h3>
  <ul><li>Hey everybody, welcome to your daily update for SOL and BTC.</li><li>So couple of closers yesterday bought um price back up into some key levels, 2day, 4 day, that kind of thing.</li><li>Uh I don't think we've quite completed the 5day um on SOL yet, but uh we did hit I think the 4day to the scent and then bounce back down off that.</li><li>If it was to dip, it would be back to the 17 um six sort of area. if it was to uh on SOL and if it was to pump you know up to that 196 197 area.</li><li>So which it may head to now just to like I say complete that 5day um for BTC then yeah anything up into the into that sort of 112 to 113 area and we still have that lower liquidity that hasn't really been taken out yet back down to that 108.</li><li>Uh if we look at it on the 7-day, 7-day would be slightly stacked towards the bulls.</li></ul>
