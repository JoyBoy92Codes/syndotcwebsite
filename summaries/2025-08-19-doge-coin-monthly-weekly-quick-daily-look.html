  <h3>TL;DR</h3><ul><li>Um, and then with the assumption that because it's broken the range trend, it's going to break through this high, which then means it's broken all of this an…</li><li>Um but yeah, you could look at this trend on the daily and if it closes back up inside this area here, which would be back up inside the break levels.</li><li>Um maybe just take a little bit of profit off at the um trend or at this level here, which would be the daily um origin breakout level.</li></ul>
  <h3>Context</h3><p>Um, and then with the assumption that because it's broken the range trend, it's going to break through this high, which then means it's broken all of this and then it can go up.</p>
  <h3>Key Levels</h3><table style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;margin-top:.5rem">
        <thead><tr><th>Asset</th><th>Level</th><th>Role</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody><tr><td></td><td>21</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>31</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>39</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>12</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>2987</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>15</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody>

  <h3>Setups</h3><p style="color:#9aa3b2">No explicit setups.</p>
  <h3>Takeaways</h3><ul><li>Um the first target if it manages to break out of this trend would be up here to um 31 cents.</li><li>Um and then if it closes over then you'd look for a bounce off the top of that range and then up to probably up to alltime high from there.</li><li>You pretty much want to get a week that closes over top of this trend, over top of those two levels, and then it's just going to start hunting these various levels um up above until eventually it reaches an all-time high and then price discovery from there.</li><li>So um if it taps that break level, closes back up on the inside, then that could be another trigger to um enter as well.</li></ul>
  
  <h3>Notable Details</h3>
  <ul><li>Um, so we're down at what, 21 cents at the moment.</li><li>I mean, it may it may have a little bit of a may have a little bit of a road stop around around the older time frame, sort of around that 39 C mark, but yeah, it doesn't look too bad.</li><li>Uh you don't you haven't hit your break level here at 12 8 was that 2987.</li><li>Um, another break level forming at 15.</li><li>So, so 25450.</li><li>If we can close a week over 25450, um, then you should see a bigger breakout.</li></ul>
