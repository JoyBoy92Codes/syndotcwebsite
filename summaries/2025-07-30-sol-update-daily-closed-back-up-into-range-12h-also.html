  <h3>TL;DR</h3><ul><li>Um so we crept back up inside the daily break level and inside the 12H break level just to retest the trend which um is pretty normal to see right near the e…</li><li>Um summary version is that this liquidates people and then they hang around here as long as possible for people to capitulate um close their positions when y…</li><li>Um, so really just uh shorts are still open from up here in the 200 area and keep those open, but um uh yeah, adding to longs as as we go down and just start…</li></ul>
  <h3>Context</h3><p>Um summary version is that this liquidates people and then they hang around here as long as possible for people to capitulate um close their positions when you know cuz they just don't want to sit there at a loss for too long and then right near the end of the candle it goes back up to find the trend which is which is what it's um main goal is to do once it hits a break.</p>
  <h3>Key Levels</h3><table style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;margin-top:.5rem">
        <thead><tr><th>Asset</th><th>Level</th><th>Role</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody><tr><td></td><td>186</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>200</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody>
      </table>
  <h3>Setups</h3><p style="color:#9aa3b2">No explicit setups.</p>
  <h3>Takeaways</h3><ul><li>Um just very subtle little tricky thing there where uh when the trend um or before the push to the dip, it actually just stops short there.</li><li>So um or early days, early hours, so it um yeah, it can go up and push through there.</li><li>So, looking just ahead to tomorrow, which um we're jumping the gun a little bit on it, but looking ahead to tomorrow, we've we got a hold level up here.</li><li>There'SA pretty good case for us to come back up now to that 186, which um makes a bit of sense if you want to deposit that liquidity somewhere that you swipe down here.</li></ul>
  
  <h3>Notable Details</h3>
  <ul><li>All we had was um a close of a one day and and obviously all the lower time frames that sit below it like 12H uh which is what we've got here on the screen.</li><li>Uh, and we could look at areas up here, um, backside of the 12H.</li><li>We've bounced off the exterior 2-day trend.</li></ul>
