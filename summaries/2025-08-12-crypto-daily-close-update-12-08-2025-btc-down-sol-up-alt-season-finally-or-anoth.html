  <h3>TL;DR</h3><ul><li>Um, it's, uh, there's another sort of way you can view this, um, which at least sort of shows you a wee bit about how it's changed, uh, which is this.</li><li>Uh so all these people that are down here um they might be feeling safe but it really doesn't take much particularly if BTC was to do a bit of a spike up and…</li><li>It's it this was the trade from yesterday which was taking this interior um range well it's actually a range trend but taking this range trend and taking it …</li></ul>
  <h3>Context</h3><p>It's it this was the trade from yesterday which was taking this interior um range well it's actually a range trend but taking this range trend and taking it back to 179 which um you know would have been a $7 scalp but um ITB 50% there waited to see what would happen and obviously it's just gone absolutely berserk.</p>
  <h3>Key Levels</h3><table style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;margin-top:.5rem">
        <thead><tr><th>Asset</th><th>Level</th><th>Role</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody><tr><td></td><td>48</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>119</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>30</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>122</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>124</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody>
      </table>
  <h3>Setups</h3><p style="color:#9aa3b2">No explicit setups.</p>
  <h3>Takeaways</h3><ul><li>So, as you can see, it's pretty much flatlining um to the upside on the 7-day and quite a bit there to go and grab on the um uh on the downside.</li><li>So, um, in one of the more, uh, low or midterm sort of, um, closes today and in SOL, um, on that 30-day, you've still got sort of up to that 200s, those low 200s, 210 starting to pop in there.</li><li>Uh you can see we've absolutely pumped off the uh range trend there and we've gone straight up and we've targeted the um the trend.</li><li>So if we stay over that break level and manage to hard close it uh with a daily candle in accumulation um and at this level that could be one close that actually hard closes both the break level and the trend and then we've got a break level and another hold level.</li></ul>
  
  <h3>Notable Details</h3>
  <ul><li>Um, bringing you your uh, daily update for SOL BTC market cap liquidity.</li><li>But the last 48 hours um as I mentioned before uh basically the time where they go crazy.</li><li>What's quite interesting is BTC has been staying very flat.</li><li>Um, ETH's been the shining star and our uh today SOL starting to take off.</li><li>Um, as as BTC gets boring and people start to cash it in, they move it into the next one and then when it finally gets boring, then you know all the all the souls and the axes and all the other sort of L1 start to take off.</li><li>Uh BTC sitting relatively even. you know, a few people are taking out longs, but it hasn't really gone up or down.</li></ul>
