  <h3>TL;DR</h3><ul><li>Um so to start with uh our 30-day liquidity um we've got uh still more longs on BTC. people have gone a little bit more towards the shorts on on SOL for the …</li><li>Uh and if we look at one day um you can see a much greater you know everyone's very bearish which is more to say that people were very very bullish but they'…</li><li>So next one's going to open underneath. potentially there'll be some resistance and and it's very likely we'll come back down and test this 110 um probably p…</li></ul>
  <h3>Context</h3><p>So next one's going to open underneath. potentially there'll be some resistance and and it's very likely we'll come back down and test this 110 um probably pretty soon looking at that the daily on Bitcoin uh it's definitely losing its range trends um so these trends that are coming through here have been lost it's pulling back underneath the unbroken daily resistance and again we've got these levels down here 111 110 that that need to be retested So, looks like we're going to have uh some blood on the streets.</p>
  <h3>Key Levels</h3><table style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;margin-top:.5rem">
        <thead><tr><th>Asset</th><th>Level</th><th>Role</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody><tr><td></td><td>30</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>168</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>160</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>186</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody>
      </table>
  <h3>Setups</h3><p style="color:#9aa3b2">No explicit setups.</p>
  <h3>Takeaways</h3><ul><li>Um if we come through and have a look at what's happening on the 2-day close, the candle's trying to position itself on so that the next one can open on the wrong side of the trend.</li><li>Um it's crazy because it's it's evident, you know, what they want to do.</li><li>The reason I just want to show you this one is the 53day actually has a trend retest and a hold level down here at 96k which is a bit scary cuz if it rejects off the back of that currently we are thinking we should see 110 but there is one time frame here now that is that's got a very good case to go see 96.</li><li>If the price is looking super weak and you're looking to get an entry, if it does dip to 110, just chuck a low time frame trend on it, follow the trend down, wait for it to break, maybe a decent break, a 1 hour, 4 hour shift in market structure before you enter, just in case that the real game is to make everyone think 110 and then come here.</li></ul>
  
  <h3>Notable Details</h3>
  <ul><li>Um just bringing you daily update for BTC SOL market cap uh liquidity uh monthly close today too.</li><li>Um if we look at 7day as you can see you know everyone's starting to get a little bit bearish.</li><li>So some of these areas down to about 168 on the one day um I think you may even see them before before we get to tomorrow.</li><li>Uh, so if we look at, um, SOL, let's look at SOL.</li><li>Like, we could have just taken a bounce and and gone for uh gone for alltime highs as a target or at least um target the break level uh up here, you know, around that 230s.</li><li>So certainly that's brings confluence to the these 160 areas that are that are sitting here and wait.</li></ul>
