  <h3>TL;DR</h3><ul><li>But either way that liquidity is looking a bit bit sketchy on um SOL and definitely we could see a swipe in both directions on BTC. they're really really out…</li><li>So I would be thinking that um if this does take a dip back to trend, if it does take AA dip back to um the hold level even um I mean realistically a closeup…</li><li>It's um and then if BTC does do that dive to 110, first time I'm going to say this, but maybe we do not see those 150s, we might just bounce from the 170s at…</li></ul>
  <h3>Context</h3><p>So I would be thinking that um if this does take a dip back to trend, if it does take AA dip back to um the hold level even um I mean realistically a closeup here is showing that the strength of BTC versus SOL is really going to start to push towards SOL.</p>
  <h3>Key Levels</h3><table style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;margin-top:.5rem">
        <thead><tr><th>Asset</th><th>Level</th><th>Role</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody><tr><td></td><td>188</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>187</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>116</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>110</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody>
      </table>
  <h3>Setups</h3><p style="color:#9aa3b2">No explicit setups.</p>
  <h3>Takeaways</h3><ul><li>Um, but we still do have that little bit of liquidity there um on on the chart which would really take everything on the one day if we did that.</li><li>Um, now our downside targets are still there. um we're going to be very heavily um uh bullish in this liquidity if we take any more to this upside.</li><li>And um what's starting to happen now is all this 100x leverage is starting to come in at 185 and um areas like 184 and you know because the crypto market is really quite a small market in the scheme of things.</li><li>Normally the range trends would would test the um hold level and then what they do is they close and they create a new range trend which is going to be that and then the first touch of that range trend normally is some kind of rejection but because you've got this older range trend coming through here it may just it could even just reject to there uh might stay within that six area.</li></ul>
  
  <h3>Notable Details</h3>
  <ul><li>Uh just recording um your update for today on BTC SOL total market cap um and liquidity.</li><li>Um, we've got on the one day liquidity, SOL has pretty much gone up and hit those one day targets nearly.</li><li>Like I was expecting 188 and I know it's kind of um splitting hairs, but I think we stopped at about 187 point something.</li><li>And then um when you look at BTC, BTC is just living in the middle.</li><li>So, you know, we're a spike up in BTC to 116 would wipe out the longs.</li><li>Um but there'SA very clear path in there down to 110 as well.</li></ul>
