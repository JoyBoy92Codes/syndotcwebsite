  <h3>TL;DR</h3><ul><li>So uh yeah, people have been opening positions um high risk, high leverage uh really close to current price, which uh it's kind of exactly what um big player…</li><li>Um, the only thing I starting to see though, and we'll see this when we start to look at the charts, is they might build additional hold levels at lower pric…</li><li>Um, and pretty much what we're seeing here now is we're seeing uh all the way from the very top here, we're seeing it didn't quite hit the break level, stopp…</li></ul>
  <h3>Context</h3><p>Um, and pretty much what we're seeing here now is we're seeing uh all the way from the very top here, we're seeing it didn't quite hit the break level, stopped short, and then we're seeing daily resistance getting built, not getting tested, maybe now some new daily resistance.</p>
  <h3>Key Levels</h3><table style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;margin-top:.5rem">
        <thead><tr><th>Asset</th><th>Level</th><th>Role</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody><tr><td></td><td>16800</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>14</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>1400</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>112</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>118</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>244</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody>
      </table>
  <h3>Setups</h3><p style="color:#9aa3b2">No explicit setups.</p>
  <h3>Takeaways</h3><ul><li>And if we, uh, you know, on BTC, that pretty much still just lines up with that same 112 um 112500ish to the downside and, uh, 118 um, 900ish to the upside.</li><li>So, as you can see, it's just getting very very very dense top and bottom on BTC. um SOL has taken a little bit to the downside and you know as soon as it does that people are opening up these shorts and as you can see the price is just traveling up to them.</li><li>So, um, yeah, and BTC, um, it just seems like it'SA matter of time before it takes everything that's that's on here, uh, all this dense red stuff in both directions.</li><li>Uh the real question is whether it actually stops at 114s and then um has a bounce or whether there's just so many people who are going to long 114 that as soon as the price enters that do we suddenly see a whole bunch of liquidity appearing down here below 113, you know, in between 113 and 112.</li></ul>
  
  <h3>Notable Details</h3>
  <ul><li>Hey everyone, welcome to your daily update for SOL and BTC.</li><li>So, looking uh looking at the one day BTC, it's just very clear now.</li><li>There's just that cluster up to 16800 um and down to 14 uh down to that 1400 again.</li><li>And then that next cluster is down into the um uh 112 sort of levels.</li><li>And if it pushes higher, it would sort of be up to that 118 level.</li><li>Um, for SOL that's same sort of thing.</li></ul>
