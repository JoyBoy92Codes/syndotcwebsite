  <h3>TL;DR</h3><ul><li>Uh, as far as SOL, um, sort of revisiting 185 as a bit of a cluster or revisiting something up to say 191, um, would be actually bullish if they go to 191 be…</li><li>And if it does open sort of where it is now at about 1697, then it it will bounce down to retest one of these hold levels or um one of these origin levels or…</li><li>Now if we look at uh Bitcoin dominance stable dominance um the rejection is still in play uh it is sitting above the trend and so for there to be a pump on a…</li></ul>
  <h3>Context</h3><p>And if it does open sort of where it is now at about 1697, then it it will bounce down to retest one of these hold levels or um one of these origin levels or the break level. anything around that 115 um sorry 158 or 157 sort of level um and maybe that exterior trend but uh but ultimately that is a very very strong position for that to be um so that's looking pretty good.</p>
  <h3>Key Levels</h3><table style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;margin-top:.5rem">
        <thead><tr><th>Asset</th><th>Level</th><th>Role</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody><tr><td></td><td>12</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>00</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>48</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>115</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>185</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>191</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody>
      </table>
  <h3>Setups</h3><p style="color:#9aa3b2">No explicit setups.</p>
  <h3>Takeaways</h3><ul><li>Um and there's obviously no weeklies and no monthlies because um it's uh it's not the end of the week or the end of a month.</li><li>Now, as far as uh liquidity goes, um one day Bitcoin, one day SOL um is flipping bearish.</li><li>We're seeing these 170s and we're seeing the on on SOL and we're seeing these um 110k sort of levels uh as still looking like the obvious targets if they keep moving down.</li><li>So, um, now if if we look at what's been happening on SOL, uh, it's sort of been the opposite.</li></ul>
  
  <h3>Notable Details</h3>
  <ul><li>Hi everyone, welcome to your daily update for um BTC and SOL and market cap and everything.</li><li>There's no 3 days, there's no 5 days, there's just no multiples.</li><li>And so, and that follows all the way through to the UTC 12:00 close um tomorrow.</li><li>So, you you basically get 48 hours of let's raise hell and um liquidate a whole bunch of people if we want to and then we can completely reverse that.</li><li>Um and then if if they were to do a bit of a bounce uh I think and we'll I'll show you when we get to the charts, but I think there'SA bit of reason why they might go back to 115 just to try and trick people and bring in a bit more lower liquidity.</li><li>Um as far as um hitting like that 115 level, all that would do is it would get more people confident to long and then all this liquidity to the downside would build up.</li></ul>
