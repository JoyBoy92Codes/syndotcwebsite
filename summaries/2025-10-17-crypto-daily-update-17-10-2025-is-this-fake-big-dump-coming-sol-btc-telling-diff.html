  <h3>Context</h3><p>SOL's found some high time frame support and could definitely bounce uh from here, but of course it's not going to do that if BTC absolutely tanks and uh yeah, we're sitting under some pretty important levels. we're sitting right on top of some pretty important trends and the liquidity uh if we look at it just here on the one day has basically evened out on both.</p>
  <h3>Key Levels</h3><table style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;margin-top:.5rem">
        <thead><tr><th>Asset</th><th>Level</th><th>Role</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody><tr><td></td><td>30</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>16707</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>17409</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>66.72</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody>
      </table>
  <h3>Setups</h3><p style="color:#9aa3b2">No explicit setups.</p>
  <h3>Takeaways</h3><ul><li>Um, but because we haven't really closed these levels up here, there's also the ability for this to pull back up before the end of the day.</li><li>Um, but if it does close up here and we're above this 66.72 level and we're too close to the new trend, then it can just open and propel itself up off those and start to target these 68s, etc. again.</li><li>Um, we've tapped the break level of the daily range, which means that break level either we either need to spend now time above that break level um to convert it into an origin sport and then bounce it uh or we're just going to go through it.</li><li>And what and what's happening is the support levels are actually coming up, which uh means the price will then continue to go up and actually try to target some of these upper levels or break back into these upper levels.</li></ul>
  
  <h3>Notable Details</h3>
  <ul><li>Uh, welcome to your daily update for Solen BTC.</li><li>But um there is potential today that it loses some pretty big levels uh particularly on BTC.</li><li>So SOL kind of a bit deceptive.</li><li>7-day you'd think that they're going to push to the upside, but we'll have a look at these structural closes and see how they close today. and 30-day, you know, you definitely think they should push to the upside.</li><li>So, um daily SOL BTC strength, uh it came down.</li><li>Um, so that 16707 level, that's the sort of level you need to get into if you actually want to break this downtrend.</li></ul>
