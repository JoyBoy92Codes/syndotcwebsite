  <h3>Context</h3><p>SOL's going to find a level of support and once it hits that level of support it's probably going to be quite sticky whereas BTC might still actually push further to the downside and so of course you'll get a little bit more downside obviously on SOL but it it will it will flip its strength because know um there's just no point selling a token down if there's just not really the equivalent piles of leverage to be grabbing there.</p>
  <h3>Key Levels</h3><table style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;margin-top:.5rem">
        <thead><tr><th>Asset</th><th>Level</th><th>Role</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody><tr><td></td><td>190</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>30</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>143</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>144</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>115</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>48</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody>

  <h3>Setups</h3><p style="color:#9aa3b2">No explicit setups.</p>
  <h3>Takeaways</h3><ul><li>However, SOL SOL was in a bit of a funny situation yesterday where it got really sticky around the monthly trend and didn't go and take the liquidity in that sort of 190 plus area um that's available on the 30-day um chart.</li><li>So when you get um something like SOL where there wasn't really a lot of shorts to be taken, something like BTC where there was tons of shorts to be taken, then you find that one of them just sort of gets stuck there while the other one goes and does its thing and it's liquidations before reversing.</li><li>Um and still looking for that 110K area on BTC, although 115 is the thing that's got um quite a bit of confluence to it at the moment. um on BTC.</li><li>Um but realistically if it closes down where it is or anywhere sort of below this um range trend here which is about uh 14925 then you'd expect it to come back up and possibly even have a rejection off the back of that.</li></ul>
  
  <h3>Notable Details</h3>
  <ul><li>Um so we've done a pretty good clearance of uh of the one day liquidity on both SOL and um BTC.</li><li>So um if we continue on down on the 7day which is looking quite bullish still on BTC then that that sort of allows it to hit the you know that big 115k cluster or or keep on going down.</li><li>Um that would mean that you know we still see more downside to SOL.</li><li>Uh so still thinking 160s, 150s, even sort of those those deep deep targets.</li><li>Um if the liquidity becomes worth grabbing, those deep targets down there at 143 144 are definitely AA high time frame possibility on SOL.</li><li>You you basically get that 48 hour window to create chaos, go liquidate, stop people out.</li></ul>
