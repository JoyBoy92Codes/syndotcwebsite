  <h3>TL;DR</h3><ul><li>Um, but at this stage it's kind of hard because the next rejection in theory should come somewhere between 180 and 187 and there's two different trends to lo…</li><li>It's it's more likely once this breaks out that it's going to want to try and head up um to one of the upper trends.</li><li>The two-day obviously hasn't closed yet and still has another day to go on it, but as you can see, it's really just overextended um through the two-day trend…</li></ul>
  <h3>Context</h3><p>Um, but at this stage it's kind of hard because the next rejection in theory should come somewhere between 180 and 187 and there's two different trends to look at and then that would uh send it all the way down to start the path down to say 153.</p>
  <h3>Key Levels</h3><table style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;margin-top:.5rem">
        <thead><tr><th>Asset</th><th>Level</th><th>Role</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody><tr><td></td><td>117</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>175</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>176</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>30</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody>
      </table>
  <h3>Setups</h3><p style="color:#9aa3b2">No explicit setups.</p>
  <h3>Takeaways</h3><ul><li>So, and it's not really until you get to the 30-day that there's still a lot of positions that are open um up there.</li><li>So, so as it stands, all the all they're really showing us is that they're taking that stuff that was um all the beers that were shorting, they're starting to take it and uh all the bulls are coming in and start to long.</li><li>Uh as far as SOL BTC strength, uh looks like we're going to break um break out uh on the daily.</li><li>So, the so the 3-day is quite a clean um quite a clean chart really bounced off the lower trend. uh it's if it pulls back a little bit, it'll go into distribution and then it won't break that trend.</li></ul>
  
  <h3>Notable Details</h3>
  <ul><li>Um uh bringing you your BTC SOL market cap uh update for today.</li><li>Uh in the short time frame, we've got a 1 day and a 3-day.</li><li>Um so it looks like it's going to take that 117.</li><li>So we're already up there taking that 117 area.</li><li>Uh, and looking at the big cluster on SOL, it looks like it's going to hit that 175 area.</li><li>Um on the 7-day as you can see uh we're running a bit short on 7-day shorts to take.</li></ul>
