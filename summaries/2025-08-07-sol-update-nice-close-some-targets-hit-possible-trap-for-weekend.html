  <h3>TL;DR</h3><ul><li>Um it would be understandable if the monthly move hit that trend uh which is sitting there at about 179 and didn't poke through to the 181 like that would be…</li><li>So, just uh don't go too big on positions uh into that weekly support just in case it actually comes through that and hits these um these monthly trends down…</li><li>I think there's sort of two possible outcomes and that's that um we're either going to go up because everyone's expecting one final flush and that's what mar…</li></ul>
  <h3>Context</h3><p>So, just uh don't go too big on positions uh into that weekly support just in case it actually comes through that and hits these um these monthly trends down here. uh because you'd be underwater by um $102 by the time we got to those or more maybe.</p>
  <h3>Key Levels</h3><table style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;margin-top:.5rem">
        <thead><tr><th>Asset</th><th>Level</th><th>Role</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody><tr><td></td><td>156</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>175</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>153</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>181</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>179</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody>
      </table>
  <h3>Setups</h3><p style="color:#9aa3b2">No explicit setups.</p>
  <h3>Takeaways</h3><ul><li>Um I just thought I'd show you something cuz it's uh SOL sort of run into a bit of weakness just um as of now.</li><li>Um, from a monthly perspective, you'd expect us to sort of sneak up at least to this trend that's up here.</li><li>Um now, we do have a weekly level down inside this monthly and we've also got some weekly um hold targets, etc. up here.</li><li>So either they're just waiting for maybe the New York session tonight and London session or something and then they'll give you know some big paroic pump up into that resistance and from that point um we might actually create a bit of a dump uh back down to this 153 area.</li></ul>
  
  <h3>Notable Details</h3>
  <ul><li>Daily close um for SOL and BTC was actually quite bullish.</li><li>So, effectively, you know, our entry there at 156 uh has now hit that 175 level.</li><li>So, let's just have a look at that on a 1 hour.</li><li>So, we've hit that level and we're starting to create a 1 hour downtrend, which um is interesting because it really should have pushed up a bit further.</li><li>So, it'SA range of about 153 through to 181.</li><li>Uh the other thing I just wanted to point out is that if we do hit this monthly trend and we start to reject um then the monthly support is down in the 140s.</li></ul>
