  <h3>TL;DR</h3><ul><li>As far as BTC, it's kind of interesting because it's it's had a lot of hard closes and it's got a lot of high time frame support, but um uh so it does beg th…</li><li>Um but whether it would hold and actually give you much more of a push up into the top um resistance is a whole another question because it's relatively low …</li><li>Um but really what we need this thing to do is we need it to close a day uh completely separated from that 64.91 line. um we really need it to be uh somewher…</li></ul>
  <h3>Context</h3><p>Um but really what we need this thing to do is we need it to close a day uh completely separated from that 64.91 line. um we really need it to be uh somewhere in the next couple of days because otherwise it's going to convert this level here to high time frame support which means that you'll have uh 64.71.</p>
  <h3>Key Levels</h3><table style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;margin-top:.5rem">
        <thead><tr><th>Asset</th><th>Level</th><th>Role</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody><tr><td></td><td>238</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>212</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>240</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>118</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>114</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody>
      </table>
  <h3>Setups</h3><p style="color:#9aa3b2">No explicit setups.</p>
  <h3>Takeaways</h3><ul><li>Uh they'd have to start actually breaking some of that support and flipping it back into resistance again if they if they want to really bring it down um to these sort of 118 uh or or lower levels, which maybe is the plan.</li><li>If we when we look at that later, if we close the fiveday into trend and it bounces back up to reject off the back side of the trend, it might end up taking that 100x leverage that's up there at 232 before it rejects and goes further down.</li><li>So, um, see I just that could go up there then come down here or it could just leave it there, let it get confident, let this gap in here get filled up, go down and then up.</li><li>And then this was sort of our first bounce through these these days here up to the 1st of October. and then we had that push up um which it broke the trend, created a new trend and then we've just been rejecting um from that trend ever since.</li></ul>
  
  <h3>Notable Details</h3>
  <ul><li>Now, welcome to your daily update for SOL and BTC.</li><li>I actually had expected we'd go a little bit higher u with SOL yesterday.</li><li>II really thought we'd push up to that 238 level, but um it appears not.</li><li>Our daily support sort of kicks in when we get down into the uh about that 212 area, which would pretty much be a complete wipe of all of the liquidity to the downside on the one day.</li><li>And um and then we've still got those targets 238 240 uh to the upside.</li><li>So, um, at this stage, you know, I'm looking to see how it reacts when it sort of hits each basic thousand increment on the way down with the key level on a high time frame on the chart showing up at about 114.</li></ul>
