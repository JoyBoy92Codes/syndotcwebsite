  <h3>TL;DR</h3><ul><li>Um, and it may be, you know, they don't always come down and take all this, but certainly if they wanted to go and, you know, tap that um 214, 213 uh area, u…</li><li>Um and you know the sentiment on um X's flipped pretty quickly as everyone was talking you know retire on everything and let's go to a,000 and all this kind …</li><li>Um so we've been sideways just in the shorter term since we sort of came down to around this um 115k area and we have got some like low time frame supports i…</li></ul>
  <h3>Context</h3><p>Um and you know the sentiment on um X's flipped pretty quickly as everyone was talking you know retire on everything and let's go to a,000 and all this kind of stuff and now people are starting to talk you know 95k um BTC and you know we told you it was going to dump after the rate cuts and you know all that kind of stuff but you know short short version is everyone got really bullish liquidity built up to the downside it became efficient for that liquidity to be used um for players to open their positions and uh and we've had a bit of a pullback and that is that is the market.</p>
  <h3>Key Levels</h3><table style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;margin-top:.5rem">
        <thead><tr><th>Asset</th><th>Level</th><th>Role</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody><tr><td></td><td>253</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>231</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>114</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>112</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>214</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody>
      </table>
  <h3>Setups</h3><p style="color:#9aa3b2">No explicit setups.</p>
  <h3>Takeaways</h3><ul><li>So, I'm sort of watching to see whether we come down to this uh 112 um which would also mean coming down to about uh 214, which seems outside of the daily scope um at this stage on on SOL.</li><li>So, you know, we've got these few days coming up where they could go a little bit nuts. um and do a big liquidity hunt um either direction and still within those few days come back to where we are now quite easily.</li><li>Um, so if you just go into the settings for the liquidity indicator if anyone's using this and there'SA video in the educational section about how to set this up, but you can turn on things like um directional bias and you can also turn on things like market order bubbles um, which I just changed to diamonds cuz there's too many bubbles in this thing otherwise.</li><li>So it could be useful if if people are trying to um analyze reversals um because you know price doesn't always go to these red lines um contrary to you know what what people think.</li></ul>
  
  <h3>Notable Details</h3>
  <ul><li>Hey everyone, welcome to your update uh for SOL and BTC today.</li><li>Um we had hit that 253 daily resistance level.</li><li>So you know we could we could easily push down to sort of like that 231 level on SOL uh 114 or down.</li><li>I'm sort of watching this 112600 112800 level um as mentioned the other day based on a 10day trend shift um which was pretty confluent across uh BTC and SOL.</li><li>But uh if we have a look up at our 7-day liquidity um then yeah, definitely we could be heading down to that 112 area and you know that sort of gets us down into the 220s.</li><li>Um, and if we have a look at the 30-day liquidity, uh, 30-day still got, you know, a lot of bullish longs in it.</li></ul>
