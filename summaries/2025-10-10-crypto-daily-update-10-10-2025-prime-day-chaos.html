  <h3>TL;DR</h3><ul><li>Um there was this, you know, months and months and months ago, we were talking about this level down at about 144 where they hadn't quite hit the hold level.…</li><li>Uh I mean even even the high time frame liquidity is just completely wiped out. the bounce back from it has been very very bullish which um uh if it is to ho…</li><li>But really the you don't know whether this kind of thing is going to become a monthly downtrend until you see the close um because it could create a hold lev…</li></ul>
  <h3>Context</h3><p>Um there was this, you know, months and months and months ago, we were talking about this level down at about 144 where they hadn't quite hit the hold level. and it was just weird and it's the kind of weird that you just one day expect to see um some revisit but who would have thought that it went down and hit it today in a single single candle so um so I guess in uh common sense terms liquidity is now to the upside probably wherever you look I'd say looking at 7day looking at 30-day it's probably all to the upside uh BTC might have another little sweep to the bottom it's quite amazing how many people actually longed that dip um for that liquid.</p>
  <h3>Key Levels</h3><table style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;margin-top:.5rem">
        <thead><tr><th>Asset</th><th>Level</th><th>Role</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody><tr><td></td><td>180</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>144</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>30</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>120</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>17</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody>
      </table>
  <h3>Setups</h3><p style="color:#9aa3b2">No explicit setups.</p>
  <h3>Takeaways</h3><ul><li>Um pushing back up and getting above some of these key levels like 114 or getting back up above the 190s uh in a timely manner, we're probably going to go up.</li><li>So, you want to see it get back up above 17 um triple0 by the end of the day or preferably back up above this range trend at 17208 and then it could have a chance of um, regaining strength, bouncing off that range trend and coming back up.</li><li>Um, not the kind of thing that you want to see if if you're talking about um, you know, altcoins for for uh, BTC and and stables to be doing a massive spike up like this.</li><li>But if this does a full reversal and ends up um sweeping this range and then pushing up to this higher level then it's going to come all the way up to this sort of 20.05 5 area.</li></ul>
  
  <h3>Notable Details</h3>
  <ul><li>Uh just uh welcome to your daily update for SOL and BTC.</li><li>We came down, we got to that 180 area.</li><li>Um some exchanges went down to, you know, 140s uh which is pretty insane.</li><li>That's the that's actually 30-day liquidity.</li><li>II thought that yeah, they were definitely gearing up for it with um losing that that 120 level that um we spoke about yesterday.</li><li>So um yeah, it lost the the 17 18.5 level and then it lost the 116.8 and then it was just you know cascade from there.</li></ul>
