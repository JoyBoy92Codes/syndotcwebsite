  <h3>TL;DR</h3><ul><li>Uh the daily target for uh the thexum daily target for uh SOL based on bouncing off the um front side hold level that's already been hit as well.</li><li>Um but at the same time, we go back to that one day and one day says suddenly people have gone, &quot;Oh, actually, maybe we're not.&quot; And they're starting to long…</li><li>So looking at SOL BTC on the daily um the first the first thing that you know stands out to me still and you said this yesterday as well is that we haven't a…</li></ul>
  <h3>Context</h3><p>Um but at the same time, we go back to that one day and one day says suddenly people have gone, &quot;Oh, actually, maybe we're not.&quot; And they're starting to long. as far as you know the the algos and you know the whales and people who want to make money it's what they love because now there's just liquidity in both directions and that therefore it means they can sell into one side buy it all at a discount then sell into the other side sell it all at a premium so you as this starts to build up on both sides that's when you that's when you'll start to see moves happening and thex-day you can see is uh funnily enough quite bearish on Bitcoin still but Um, SOL is there a lot of obviously true believers, I guess.</p>
  <h3>Key Levels</h3><table style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;margin-top:.5rem">
        <thead><tr><th>Asset</th><th>Level</th><th>Role</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>

  <h3>Setups</h3><p style="color:#9aa3b2">No explicit setups.</p>
  <h3>Takeaways</h3><ul><li>Um, we have got liquidity kind of building up to the downside because um it appears on the on the one day all it takes is AA few dollar move up and people will start to chase.</li><li>Uh but in all fairness um you know if you'd got in uh down when we were hitting thosexxs you'd be in a good position right now.</li><li>Uh but it also means that as that liquidity builds up um if if we run into anything that's going to reject price then we could see a little bit of a move down.</li><li>And um you know, it's kind of the best time to send the price uh on a bit of a liquidation hunt. and um and not affect overall structure.</li></ul>
  
  <h3>Notable Details</h3>
  <ul><li>Hi everyone, welcome to your daily update for SOL and BTC.</li><li>So, looking at the liquidity just specifically on on BTC, yeah, anything around thatxorxarea would be just absolutely normal based on thexday liquidity at the moment, the way it's built up.</li><li>And we did hit that uh thosexs nearly into thatxarea, which is where I said we probably run into the the backside of the the next range up and run into some resistance.</li><li>The one thing with there being a prime day tomorrow though is that sometimes you will close above a key level, then they'll take advantage of there being no structural closes for, you know,xtoxhours.</li><li>Uh so if we do get a sweep on um something like SOLxs would be really normal just based purely on that liquidity build up.</li><li>But just also don't forget we still have not gone to thosextargets that um that were on things like the I think they were either thexor thexday time frames.</li></ul>
