  <h3>TL;DR</h3><ul><li>It's it's really the newer positions are going to get liquidated even if they just get up to about umxwhich uh you might have Oh, alerts going off.</li><li>So, there's there's newer longs coming in, there's newer shorts coming in, which um just gives them plenty of ability to move in either direction quite quick…</li><li>So we might find that this becomes you know a reversal for the strength of alts and that could be next week um because it might get triggered and then it mig…</li></ul>
  <h3>Context</h3><p>So we might find that this becomes you know a reversal for the strength of alts and that could be next week um because it might get triggered and then it might pump uh or so that would bexor it could dive through it in which case the pump keeps going and then it's going to be some candles later that it actually um it actually becomes hardened support.</p>
  <h3>Key Levels</h3><table style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;margin-top:.5rem">
        <thead><tr><th>Asset</th><th>Level</th><th>Role</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody><tr><td></td><td>x</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>x</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>x</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>x</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>x</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>x</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody>
      </table>
  <h3>Setups</h3><p style="color:#9aa3b2">No explicit setups.</p>
  <h3>Takeaways</h3><ul><li>Uh so looking at the liquidity um we have definitely started to push up into the shorts but um it's also very very clear that people are chasing it.</li><li>Um the hard thing to know really is whether to trust this initial pump or or whether there's going to be some kind of Monday Tuesday reversal and uh go down and get all these people that um have started to chase it.</li><li>So, let's not bother talking about liquidity today because it appears it's going to change very much by the time we get to Oh jeez, TP's going off left, right, and center on my phone as well.</li><li>Um, it would be more positive if it got back above thexxlevel because then at least it's in a position of actually being able to um hard close the break level on the next candle.</li></ul>
  
  <h3>Notable Details</h3>
  <ul><li>Welcome to your daily update for SOL and BTC.</li><li>So, as it currently stands, if they were to reverse um on the daily, thatxarea, um it's still pretty much the same key area that uh has existed.</li><li>And interestingly, on the daily, we've sort of lost a lot of thatxnow.</li><li>Might happen in the nextxinutes for all we know.</li><li>Um, so let's have a look at uh SOL BTC strength.</li><li>So whatever that number is um uhx.</li></ul>
