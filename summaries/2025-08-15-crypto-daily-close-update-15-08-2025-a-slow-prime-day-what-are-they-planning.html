  <h3>TL;DR</h3><ul><li>Um, I'll show you something on the weekly later that just sort of suggests that there's really it's at a point now where it's got to go lower if it wants to …</li><li>Um if it went to the top side of all this it would it would sort of be up to about that 125 mark but um most of that liquidity would be gone you know by the …</li><li>Uh as far as the um BTC USD um or stables risk uh risk assets um it's bouncing off that trend exactly as we thought it would.</li></ul>
  <h3>Context</h3><p>Um if it went to the top side of all this it would it would sort of be up to about that 125 mark but um most of that liquidity would be gone you know by the time I hit the 1223 area and if we look at the 30-day 30-day sort of shows all the way down to about 162 uh on SOL and and you can see that liquidity cluster sort of forming back again up to about 208 8 um through to 213 and and then you can see it's almost just a dead zone after 213.</p>
  <h3>Key Levels</h3><table style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;margin-top:.5rem">
        <thead><tr><th>Asset</th><th>Level</th><th>Role</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody><tr><td></td><td>120</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>121</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>200</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>201</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>180</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>179</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody>
      </table>
  <h3>Setups</h3><p style="color:#9aa3b2">No explicit setups.</p>
  <h3>Takeaways</h3><ul><li>So, typically prime days you'd you'd see um sort of mass liquidations or something crazy, but they do sort of roll over to the next day cuz it's not until um yeah, 25ish hours from now that we actually start to see some mass structural closes.</li><li>Um uh if BTC was to go up into about that uh 120 area it would take um it would take most of the one day stuff out.</li><li>Anything up to about that 200 201 area would be um some pretty good topside liquidations. and uh and it's it's still got some longs it could take on the one day down to sort of like 180 179.</li><li>So, um you know, if we're still at these high prices, um come October, you're talking about uh the these will be bounces that will potentially happen into the bare market, you know, but um because they are probably getting a little late in the cycle if you believe in cycles.</li></ul>
  
  <h3>Notable Details</h3>
  <ul><li>Um, just bringing you your daily update for SOL BTC crypto market cap.</li><li>Uh so as it stands at the moment um we the one day liquidity on BTC is looking a bit bearish.</li><li>SOL also looking a bit bearish.</li><li>Maybe a little bit higher if they really wanted to spike up 121. um would take out pretty much everything on the one day.</li><li>Uh if we look at the 7-day um 7-day still bearish on both.</li><li>Um so and you can see on the 7day that that cluster sort of stops at about that 202 um on uh on SOL and goes down to about 171 169 area.</li></ul>
