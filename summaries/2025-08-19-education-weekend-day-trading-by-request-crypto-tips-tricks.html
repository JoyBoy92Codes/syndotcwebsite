  <h3>TL;DR</h3><ul><li>Um if you try to hold over anything that you think is actually um a trending market or something like that from the weekend, you're probably going to find th…</li><li>So that's sort of like the New York market. um it closes and after it's closed then uh you are moving into the the quote unquote weekend time really um elos …</li><li>If you've had a pretty normal week where the price has sort of um taken the weekend liquidity and if it's um gone and had a bit of violence during the week, …</li></ul>
  <h3>Context</h3><p>So that's sort of like the New York market. um it closes and after it's closed then uh you are moving into the the quote unquote weekend time really um elos and everything still operate over the weekend there's just less volume in them there's less volumes in the market um in total order books are thinner um and like I say they're either going to range or sometimes you do just get those weekend pumps where they use the weekend thinness of order books to really push the price um in one direction so if you've had quite boring week and liquidity has been built up during the week, then you can sometimes expect that the weekend's going to give you some kind of very um violent move um because it's easy to do that when the order books are thinner.</p>
  <h3>Key Levels</h3><table style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;margin-top:.5rem">
        <thead><tr><th>Asset</th><th>Level</th><th>Role</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody><tr><td></td><td>175</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>30</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>172</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>170</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody>
      </table>
  <h3>Setups</h3><p style="color:#9aa3b2">No explicit setups.</p>
  <h3>Takeaways</h3><ul><li>Um, so, uh, to trade within the weekend days, um, there'SA few things like number one, you're probably going to be trading on time frames that are sort of 1 hour out of 4hour max.</li><li>And, um, also there's quite often just a lot of ranging um, done on weekends because ranging is what induces liquidity.</li><li>So um history always creates the future and uh when it comes to charting, so you should look at where things have come from and that will sort of give you a bit of an idea about where they're where they're going.</li><li>Um, so what we can see in here is, uh, we've hit this top during the week, which is the the range rejection from back here, and we've started to push down into the weekend.</li></ul>
  
  <h3>Notable Details</h3>
  <ul><li>Um so, let's go down look at our 1 hour.</li><li>Now, we're down to a 1 hour.</li><li>So, let's have a bit of a look and see if we have a local trend on a 1 hour.</li><li>Um and got no hold levels in there on a 1 hour.</li><li>If we break over this 1 hour trend, we'd look to take a long.</li><li>So, we've got one there, got there, uh, and then we're up to range retests at 175.</li></ul>
