  <h3>TL;DR</h3><ul><li>So, and when we look at uh our 5day um we're going to get a interior trend um on our 5day for the first time, which is that and it's also a range trend aroun…</li><li>So, these types of things normally create some form of um retest. it'll probably reject off um something in in this area that it's roughly in now if if not t…</li><li>There's there's nothing there's nothing in there really that's actually proper support until we get back to that um 114 trend that's been running through there.</li></ul>
  <h3>Context</h3><p>There's there's nothing there's nothing in there really that's actually proper support until we get back to that um 114 trend that's been running through there.</p>
  <h3>Key Levels</h3><table style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;margin-top:.5rem">
        <thead><tr><th>Asset</th><th>Level</th><th>Role</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody><tr><td></td><td>170</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>184</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>30</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody>
      </table>
  <h3>Setups</h3><p style="color:#9aa3b2">No explicit setups.</p>
  <h3>Takeaways</h3><ul><li>Um however, if we were to say, hey, you know, 30 days ago, well, 30 days ago, um clearly everyone was quite bearish and that's why there's um a lot of liquidity up there to the top side.</li><li>When you have a break, it's going to target something um to the upside, but it's going to target it from the wrong side of resistance, which means inevitably it ends up going back down again.</li><li>And uh so when the new candle opens here, maybe it pushes up here, hits it one more time, but ultimately that looks like it's just going to anything to the upside is probably just going to be a temporary little fake bounce, grab some liquidity, and then it looks like it's going to go down.</li><li>Um it's again that looks like it's tried to get up and through there and it's failed to close up inside these upper ranges.</li></ul>
  
  <h3>Notable Details</h3>
  <ul><li>Um just bringing you update for BTC SOL uh market cap um strength and all the other various bits and pieces we go through.</li><li>So on the one day um BTC looks pretty even.</li><li>Uh SOL definitely there's more bullish longs uh left to swipe on the one day.</li><li>Um areas sort of down to that 170 etc. if they were to take a little quick dip um and if they were to pump, you know, up to sort of about 184.</li><li>If we have a look at what it's like on a 7-day um in both cases, in the 7-day positions, you can see that you longs have been um piling in.</li><li>And if we look at the 30-day, there's still quite a bit of 30-day shorts to take.</li></ul>
