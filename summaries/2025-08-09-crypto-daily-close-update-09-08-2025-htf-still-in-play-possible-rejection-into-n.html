  <h3>TL;DR</h3><ul><li>Um, if we have a look at the 1day liquidity, uh, 1day liquidity, and this is this is a pretty important one, just in case we're trying to think about, you kn…</li><li>So, SOL Bitcoin, um, there's not that many closes today, structural closes, but SOL Bitcoin has hit that rejection level that we had marked out there, uh, hi…</li><li>So this if it if it was already very very much overextended um on the daily back here on the 7th and it's retraced to create a trend uh on the 8th and now it…</li></ul>
  <h3>Context</h3><p>Um, if we have a look at the 1day liquidity, uh, 1day liquidity, and this is this is a pretty important one, just in case we're trying to think about, you know, weekend um, weekend traps, uh, looks like, you know, 115K to the downside on BTC is definitely piling up and, um, you know, that sort of 119 118K to the upside piling up.</p>
  <h3>Key Levels</h3><table style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;margin-top:.5rem">
        <thead><tr><th>Asset</th><th>Level</th><th>Role</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody><tr><td></td><td>119</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>172</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>185</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>160</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>30</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody>
      </table>
  <h3>Setups</h3><p style="color:#9aa3b2">No explicit setups.</p>
  <h3>Takeaways</h3><ul><li>Um if it closes over that but on the wrong side of trend, then you might still get a pump and then a pullback. um which would be more in line with a weekend trap really to close above one, open on the wrong side, go up, hit, go down.</li><li>It's not, you know, it's not 100% like it's going to go up, but it'SA better place to be than than uh closing down below that sort of 176 level.</li><li>So yeah, if we actually recapture that trend um at the end of the month and bounce off the backside of it, then yeah, it's uh nothing's out of the question at that point.</li><li>I'll send an update if we um get anything more, but I think it's just uh we're looking at maybe the daily is repositioning itself and then we might get one more push.</li></ul>
  
  <h3>Notable Details</h3>
  <ul><li>Hey everyone, just bringing you a daily update for SOL and BTC and market caps and all the other stuff that we look at.</li><li>The SOL um, SOL actually matches up a lot with what the current structure is.</li><li>Uh so it's sort of 172 to the downside and 185 to the upside.</li><li>7 days the sentiment is looking really bullish.</li><li>Um obviously there's liquidity down to lower levels like 111k.</li><li>Uh but there's also liquidity up to higher levels like 119K on BTC.</li></ul>
