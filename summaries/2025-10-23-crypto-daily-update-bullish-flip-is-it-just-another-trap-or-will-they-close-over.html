  <h3>TL;DR</h3><ul><li>Um and of course if they wanted to take a dive again, then you everything's still open. the the actual range of price that we're in right now is just so wide…</li><li>There's plenty to take to the downside if we look at the 7-day, but there's still something that could take to the upside. probably be a little bit wary if i…</li><li>Yeah, BTC on the 30-day really it's just do they go and take everything down to that 103 or do they go all the way up to 119.</li></ul>
  <h3>Context</h3><p>There's plenty to take to the downside if we look at the 7-day, but there's still something that could take to the upside. probably be a little bit wary if it goes up and takes everything to that area just on um BTC because then there'SA bit of AA bit of a dead space above it.</p>
  <h3>Key Levels</h3><table style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;margin-top:.5rem">
        <thead><tr><th>Asset</th><th>Level</th><th>Role</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody><tr><td></td><td>107</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>106</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>104</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>196</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>200</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody>
      </table>
  <h3>Setups</h3><p style="color:#9aa3b2">No explicit setups.</p>
  <h3>Takeaways</h3><ul><li>Um, as for uh what's been going on, well, it's been a pretty big roller coaster really.</li><li>Uh, we've had very bearish looking uh closes that have suddenly flipped bullish just before, you know, the end of the day and we've had the other the other way around as well where everything kind of looks really bullish and then suddenly it just gets pushed down.</li><li>So um if we continue to the upside, you know, there's there's absolutely no reason why we wouldn't take this uh 196 area.</li><li>Um, it's not overly bearish, though, because I'd get a little bit more bearish if it actually went down and closed below because that would mean that you've got this big long wick.</li></ul>
  
  <h3>Notable Details</h3>
  <ul><li>Hey everyone, welcome to your daily update for Solen BTC.</li><li>So, you know, if we're talking things bigger than 7-day closes, they were actually quite bad.</li><li>And the ones under the 7-day closes, well, they were quite good.</li><li>We've gone into a daily hold now on SOL.</li><li>And so that would imply that if they were just purely after hunting liquidity, then we should see some downside, you know, come to to take some of these areas like, you know, 107 and and 106 and 104.</li><li>So, uh, as far as, um, SOL goes, still got all that daily liquidity down there to the 170s.</li></ul>
