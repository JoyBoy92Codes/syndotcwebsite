  <h3>TL;DR</h3><ul><li>Um, we don't seem to have that a reason just to go there in a straight line. however, which might be why it's it sort of just coming down, stays down, builds…</li><li>There'SA lot of these positions that would have been in profit, but now they are um trapped or they're borderline, you know, and if we get another push down …</li><li>Like to really get all of this fixed, we need SOL to stay flat and BDC to spike or we need um BDC to absolutely pump and SOL to pump slightly. or if we reall…</li></ul>
  <h3>Context</h3><p>Like to really get all of this fixed, we need SOL to stay flat and BDC to spike or we need um BDC to absolutely pump and SOL to pump slightly. or if we really want to fix the monthly rejection on SOL, we actually need SOL to go down while BTC goes up.</p>
  <h3>Key Levels</h3><table style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;margin-top:.5rem">
        <thead><tr><th>Asset</th><th>Level</th><th>Role</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody><tr><td></td><td>110</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>114</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>108</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>103</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>109</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody>
      </table>
  <h3>Setups</h3><p style="color:#9aa3b2">No explicit setups.</p>
  <h3>Takeaways</h3><ul><li>You know, it's pretty hard to tell whether they'll dump hard and fast or or whether it'll be some more of a slow grind, but it's definitely at this stage looking a little bit more like it'SA correction rather than just a straight out liquidity grab.</li><li>So, um, looking at SOL, the the 108 area down to about the 103 area definitely looks like it's, um, in the sights of, uh, of the big players at the moment.</li><li>But the more we go down and stay down, the more the levels change and then we just go down and we stay down and then we go down and we stay down.</li><li>Um, so you know, if we sort of zoom out on the one minute, if there is such a thing as zooming out on the one minute, you can pretty much just see the range is exactly like what it's showing up as on the liquidity charts.</li></ul>
  
  <h3>Notable Details</h3>
  <ul><li>Hey everyone, welcome to your daily update for SOL and BTC.</li><li>So, looking at the one day here, uh clearly we could go down and take that 110 liquidity.</li><li>Um, some of the closes on BTC over the last couple of days have got some pretty low targets.</li><li>So, it's um, and you know, everyone online is talking about 90s and all that kind of thing.</li><li>So, I still think there'SA really high chance that we push up into the um one the 114 area.</li><li>Um there is some very concerning trends up around that area that could send it as low as the ' 90s.</li></ul>
