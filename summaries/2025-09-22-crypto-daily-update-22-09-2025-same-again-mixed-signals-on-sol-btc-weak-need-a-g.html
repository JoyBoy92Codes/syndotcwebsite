  <h3>TL;DR</h3><ul><li>Um the levels you know that we we see here uh same really you know 111 um sorry uh 211 on um SOL and if we were to drop down it's still sort of that you know…</li><li>So I mean the charts looked really bad and they have looked really bad for several days now. um was not quite expecting the nose dive to be so big and so fas…</li><li>It's still in that monthly, you know, monthly rejection um which, you know, isn't really going to get resolved unless it actually gets down to sort of that 0…</li></ul>
  <h3>Context</h3><p>Um the levels you know that we we see here uh same really you know 111 um sorry uh 211 on um SOL and if we were to drop down it's still sort of that you know 110 is that next sort of step in um in the 7day.</p>
  <h3>Key Levels</h3><table style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;margin-top:.5rem">
        <thead><tr><th>Asset</th><th>Level</th><th>Role</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody><tr><td></td><td>112</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>800</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>218</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>224</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>109</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>111</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody>
      </table>
  <h3>Setups</h3><p style="color:#9aa3b2">No explicit setups.</p>
  <h3>Takeaways</h3><ul><li>That actually helps correct the SOL BTC chart and then after that they can come back into sync and then um you maybe you then get a more downwards move on BTC and less downwards move on SOL you know but at the moment they're really out of sync SOL is very weak compared to BTC.</li><li>But um I'll show you on the weekly chart before this is over how they did that because it was very very very well orchestrated um with one hourly candle in exactly the right position to reject off um what I call the Trump trend which has uh been basically the key trend since the beginning of the bull run.</li><li>Um, my gut feeling just at this stage based on all the levels and and what's closing today is that much like um, we've been saying yesterday and the day before, if we don't close higher today, we probably will have another, you know, um, drop to the downside.</li><li>So, it would be um let's just call it very bearish if it closes under the 19524 level because that's basically just getting back under the range and it could just reject off the back of that and continue to dump and that would just be ultimate weakness.</li></ul>
  
  <h3>Notable Details</h3>
  <ul><li>Hey everybody, uh welcome to your daily update for BTC and SOL.</li><li>Uh looking at the liquidity um looking actually looking at the one day for BTC, you just you would not think we've had that dump.</li><li>Um, we hit the, you know, the 112 800 level.</li><li>Um now looking at SOL it does look like there has been a bit of a liquidity grab.</li><li>And so the risk here of course is that if they if you don't get a lot of shorts opening between this area like 218 and 224 then really it's just more efficient to go down make it look bad and then the shorts will continue to open up.</li><li>The front side would be down here sort of around the uh 109's 105s depending on the time frame that you look at.</li></ul>
