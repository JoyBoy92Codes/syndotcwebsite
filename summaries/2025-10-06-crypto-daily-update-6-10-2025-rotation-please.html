  <h3>TL;DR</h3><ul><li>Um, so you know, we've we've definitely got uh a bit of room to play, but because of the SOL BTC chart, you know, SOL's just been basically lagging behind BT…</li><li>So, having this gap that's at the top here and uh the day of the week and the fact we've just come through this really bullish weekend, um it might be the da…</li><li>If we get this hold level today and then we can bounce off that hold level and hopefully break through this resistance, then you can see strength come back i…</li></ul>
  <h3>Context</h3><p>So, having this gap that's at the top here and uh the day of the week and the fact we've just come through this really bullish weekend, um it might be the day that we actually start to see a bit of AA bit of a pullback, but it may not be huge because we have hard closed a lot of these levels, you know, like the 120.9 level, uh which would allow them to pretty much eat every single piece of 100x leverage that's available shortterm. um if they went down and just retested that 120.8 120.9 level on Bitcoin that's been um that's been hard closed.</p>
  <h3>Key Levels</h3><table style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;margin-top:.5rem">
        <thead><tr><th>Asset</th><th>Level</th><th>Role</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody><tr><td></td><td>240</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>124</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>126</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>140</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>220</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody>
      </table>
  <h3>Setups</h3><p style="color:#9aa3b2">No explicit setups.</p>
  <h3>Takeaways</h3><ul><li>There's there's sort of um, uh, anything up to about that one, sorry, 240 uh, and down into those um, 220s.</li><li>And when it gets boring, people look to diversify the risk. you know, they've they've become so confident with the gains and the fact that BTC has been going up and then they start to look at at altcoins to um uh gain some kind of risk and some more profits and you that's just going through the steps of the cycle really.</li><li>So if if it was to have a dip based on the 30-day uh the key, you know, blocks of liquidity basically are down to that sort of 216 218 area and then then you move down to more like your 209 210 and then you're down to your 200, you know, if it if it really goes um goes for gold and takes it all.</li><li>So, looking at the short-term liquidity heat maps, um we've got this gap here on BTC now, which is sort of that um 125 to 126 uh area.</li></ul>
  
  <h3>Notable Details</h3>
  <ul><li>Hey everyone, welcome to your daily update for SOL and BTC.</li><li>BTC's being very strong.</li><li>There'SA little bit of an indication on the short-term liquidity that um there is not uh much short-term liquidity coming in now between 124 and 126, but uh so it might be time to have a little bit of AA rollover.</li><li>If if we look at it from AA one day perspective, then there's still stuff to grab there at um at that 126.</li><li>Um, if we have a look at the 7-day, so people are really starting to trust the pump.</li><li>Um the chart the the 31day close today is sort of giving a really good um area of confluence around 114K.</li></ul>
