  <h3>TL;DR</h3><ul><li>Yeah, you could do that, but you could also just hold on to your own money and wait for this thing to actually change trend and maybe you would never buy it …</li><li>So, so okay, you could take a buy there, but you would TP half of your purchase at the trend and then you'd have your stop loss set to break even and you wou…</li><li>Um, but you know, realistically, I think everyone could just maybe learn just a little bit of basic TA and that would stop this world of, you know, accumulat…</li></ul>
  <h3>Context</h3><p>Um, but you know, realistically, I think everyone could just maybe learn just a little bit of basic TA and that would stop this world of, you know, accumulate under a dollar or, you know, next best narrative, buy this and retire on it, you know, which which seems to be so rampant in crypto.</p>
  <h3>Key Levels</h3><table style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;margin-top:.5rem">
        <thead><tr><th>Asset</th><th>Level</th><th>Role</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody><tr><td></td><td>x</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>x</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody>
      </table>
  <h3>Setups</h3><p style="color:#9aa3b2">No explicit setups.</p>
  <h3>Takeaways</h3><ul><li>There's always, you know, it's about the tech or it's something, you know, that this is going to be the next best thing, etc., etc.</li><li>And maybe this video can just sort of save one person out there, but if if someone ever says you should be buying a token, the first thing you should probably do, like if you are a spot holder, is you should look at it and you should say, well, what's the trend?</li><li>Um but you shouldn't just buy it as a spot holder, you know, and certainly the this approach of um accumulate under, you know, or DCA into or whatever as a spot holder.</li><li>You know, it's it's not the kind of thing you actually um should be buying or holding as a as a spot um position.</li></ul>
  
  <h3>Notable Details</h3>
  <ul><li>And if you've got something like, you know, Atom here, which has been in ax-year downtrend, or maybe even a nearly a threeyear downtrend, then it'SA tradable asset.</li><li>So, there'SA lot of people out there just going, &quot;No, you just you can't have ax drop in a token.</li><li>Lucky it didn't go to that because that was the next one and and I'm pretty sure that you can't go to negativexon a chart.</li><li>You could have bought this, you would have traded it up to this level, and then you would have SOL it, you know, and that's, you know, xup to xor whatever.</li></ul>
