  <h3>TL;DR</h3><ul><li>So, um, I think it's probably just completing some of that. the once it has done that though, the the the thing that's probably a little bit more of a worry …</li><li>And, um, you could have AA bias if you wanted to and say, I believe it's going to go up, and therefore, you know, I like this compression because I believe i…</li><li>So um this is this sort of um rejection here in this in the strength of safety assets is sort of why you're seeing things like sooie pop hype pop as popped y…</li></ul>
  <h3>Context</h3><p>So um this is this sort of um rejection here in this in the strength of safety assets is sort of why you're seeing things like sooie pop hype pop as popped you know there's there'SA few you know um tokens that have been going up and uh also SOL you know that's why it's sort of had that little bit of a move.</p>
  <h3>Key Levels</h3><table style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;margin-top:.5rem">
        <thead><tr><th>Asset</th><th>Level</th><th>Role</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody><tr><td></td><td>196</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>197</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>149</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>17385</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>17500</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>17671</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody>
      </table>
  <h3>Setups</h3><p style="color:#9aa3b2">No explicit setups.</p>
  <h3>Takeaways</h3><ul><li>So, interestingly, SOL has been going on a bit of a pump, but there's there's been some like we just SOL has been looking, you know, way more bullish than what BTC has.</li><li>So, first uh looking at SOL BTC strength, it's um for the daily, it's in a good position to close over top of the trend.</li><li>Uh but what we need is we need it to happen soon because if we start to look when we do look a little bit later at some of the um BTC closes that are coming in, uh at the end of the week, um we really need just market strength in general to pick up.</li><li>So that was your you had a range top all the way up here and we had failure to get across here which was resistance and we have a range bottom down here and now we might actually be creating a range in the middle there that's just really really tight.</li></ul>
  
  <h3>Notable Details</h3>
  <ul><li>Hey everybody, welcome to your daily update for SOL and BTC.</li><li>So you 100x leverage and here you've got 50x leverage and here you got 25x and and it's all actually just estimated.</li><li>And, um, so there are a couple of targets up around this 196 197 area on the 5day and stuff that have been taking a really long time to play out.</li><li>Uh I think we got like a one day or two day 149 day and um but there are some big weekly uh and multi-week closes coming up tomorrow.</li><li>So, um, if it gets down below that 17385, that'll be creating a hold level.</li><li>If it was to close, say, with no wick, uh so that means getting back up to that um 17500 or as close to it as possible, then the trend would move, but it' be on the correct side of the trend to then take off to the upside.</li></ul>
