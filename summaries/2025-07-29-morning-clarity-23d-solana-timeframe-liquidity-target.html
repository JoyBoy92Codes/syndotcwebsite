  <h3>TL;DR</h3><ul><li>Uh and then very soon after we've rejected that trend uh which shows signs of deviation or liquidity being grabbed on the lower time frame and uh we've been …</li><li>So effectively liquidations to um to gain or sorry to sell as a premium and then coming down here to liquidate to to um buy back at a discount which lines up…</li><li>Uh I don't know if it' be some kind of straight line dip because you'd probably take all this and then try to induce people to take some longs by maybe bounc…</li></ul>
  <h3>Context</h3><p>So effectively liquidations to um to gain or sorry to sell as a premium and then coming down here to liquidate to to um buy back at a discount which lines up very much with where where the hold level is um sitting on that time frame and where the trend is.</p>
  <h3>Key Levels</h3><table style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;margin-top:.5rem">
        <thead><tr><th>Asset</th><th>Level</th><th>Role</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody><tr><td></td><td>30</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>165</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody>
      </table>
  <h3>Setups</h3><p style="color:#9aa3b2">No explicit setups.</p>
  <h3>Takeaways</h3><ul><li>So, so we've got weekly supports, we've got, you know, daily supports, 3day supports, 4 day, you know, all sorts of things that that, you know, I've taken trades on um in the last few days.</li><li>Um and then there's this area here which um gets you down to about that 165 where those where those peaks are.</li><li>So, so if you've got a target to dive the trend and um maybe go down to this 165 area, it would literally just be taking all that liquidity through there.</li><li>So, um but yeah, I just thought I'd share that the the chart looks um very very clean.</li></ul>
  
  <h3>Notable Details</h3>
  <ul><li>But this is the 23day time frame, which is something um we drawn up the other day.</li><li>Um I think this closed about 3 days ago, about the same time I started posting videos.</li><li>Uh because when you look at the liquidity, you can sort of see on the 30-day that there's quite a big grouping of liquidity through here for them to take all the way down to the 70s.</li></ul>
