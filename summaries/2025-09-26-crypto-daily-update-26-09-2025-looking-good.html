  <h3>TL;DR</h3><ul><li>So the same key numbers like down to 105 on um BTC and down to sort of like the 180s uh are visible on SOL and uh we've we've had a few people come in with s…</li><li>The real question is will they take this area down to um you know 105 and you know will you see another dip down here to the sort of 180 area on um on SOL be…</li><li>It's bounced the support trend. there is a really steep range trend that's coming down from the previous um upper range and it's in a perfect position really…</li></ul>
  <h3>Context</h3><p>The real question is will they take this area down to um you know 105 and you know will you see another dip down here to the sort of 180 area on um on SOL before they go up and there'SA couple of things on the charts um and it is it'SA prime day today so there's only a one day close uh which is great makes it nice and easy but also means we can't get a huge amount of longer um like longer term insight but um the there is something on the one day BTC chart that that says that they're doing something quite sneaky and that they're gonna do a dive and they're going to grab all this, which of course will mean that um SOL might drop, but SOL has found some pretty good support on the SOL BTC chart.</p>
  <h3>Key Levels</h3><table style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;margin-top:.5rem">
        <thead><tr><th>Asset</th><th>Level</th><th>Role</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody><tr><td></td><td>105</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>180</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>30</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>108</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody>
      </table>
  <h3>Setups</h3><p style="color:#9aa3b2">No explicit setups.</p>
  <h3>Takeaways</h3><ul><li>This one's been quite fast, which um is interesting because it it does mean that there's not a lot of resistance and it's pretty easy and quick for um some of these alts to bounce back up. other ones have built a bunch of resistance but um you know some of them can come back pretty quickly.</li><li>Looking at the um 30-day, there's plenty to grab on the 30-day when it comes to BTC, but the levels are basically the same on SOL and the top side levels are confluent with where I think we're going to go on the charts.</li><li>Um I mean it may be we we are in um structural moves that can take us up you know to anything up to alltime highs or or slightly well actually I don't think we have a structural move to get above alltime high but we have some trends that we we potentially could target.</li><li>So with SOL that technically lines up with the 176 to 168 area, but the SOL BTC chart has flipped into strength. um it would be quite hard for them to get down to that area and so I don't think people have to worry about that.</li></ul>
  
  <h3>Notable Details</h3>
  <ul><li>Hey everybody, welcome to your daily update for SOL and BTC.</li><li>Uh as you can see there'SA big pile of it um available on the one day to the downside because everyone's jumped in and started longing and BTC is really even.</li><li>So, looking at the 7-day, the 7-day does look like, you know, we've we've had a decent sort of um dig down into that liquidity and most of it is aiming towards the top side.</li><li>This is on, you know, using the um using the indicators and yes, it's all averaged and nothing's perfect, but this is based on a 1 hour setting versus a 1 minute setting.</li><li>So this is longerterm liquidity that's sitting here between uh 108 down to 105.</li><li>And it's basically previous range liquidity because the the previous part of um the ranging for BTC was below 108 350.</li></ul>
