  <h3>Context</h3><p>So, when an origin level is hit, it'SA really polarized moment um on the chart, it's either going to close it and it's going to absolutely take off or it's going to get back underneath it and it's going to absolutely dump, but it's going to be one extreme or the other.</p>
  <h3>Key Levels</h3><table style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;margin-top:.5rem">
        <thead><tr><th>Asset</th><th>Level</th><th>Role</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody><tr><td></td><td>x</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>x</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>x</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>x</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>x</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>x</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody>

  <h3>Setups</h3><p style="color:#9aa3b2">No explicit setups.</p>
  <h3>Takeaways</h3><ul><li>Um uh just doing a quick concept video on um origin levels um or by their longer name they're kind of called break level origin or you can call them breakout levels.</li><li>And and I've done um done videos on that, but just in general, a break level is going to be the the highest point of distribution in a range um or it's going to be the lowest point of accumulation in a range.</li><li>So you would have another one down here as an example distribution range rejects to distribution and this is an example of when it when the origin level was hit and it didn't close over the top.</li><li>So, when you're looking for targets for origin levels, what you're trying to look for is you're actually trying to look for another origin level that exists on the other side of the chart.</li></ul>
  
  <h3>Notable Details</h3>
  <ul><li>So, so in this instance on Bitcoin here, umxdown to uh the bottom here, which was, you know, was that down to the bottom here, which wasx.</li><li>xxxfour. candles.</li><li>This candle all the way over here on thexst of May hits the top side of the distribution.</li><li>So before thexst of May, this is simply a break level.</li><li>Now likewise, if we actually skip through various different time frames, just have a show you this one on thex-day.</li><li>So, from the creation of thisx-day origin level down here to the untouched origin level up here, you longed Bitcoin from anything around thatxor lower and you TP atx.</li></ul>
