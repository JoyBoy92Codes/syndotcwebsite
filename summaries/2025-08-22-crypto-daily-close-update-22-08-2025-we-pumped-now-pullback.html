  <h3>TL;DR</h3><ul><li>Um there's potentially some kind of push that might come up into that 120 area, but um uh yeah, but there's there's some things happening at today's close th…</li><li>So, um and I think what what um what we're going to see on BTC um I think might might actually be the thing that triggers a bit of a pullback. um 30-day uh a…</li><li>So, if we can close down here in the next 2 hours, uh then you possibly expect a break um a break retest, which which might bring us back up to 65 um or we c…</li></ul>
  <h3>Context</h3><p>So, um and I think what what um what we're going to see on BTC um I think might might actually be the thing that triggers a bit of a pullback. um 30-day uh a little bit there to be taken up to about 212 um on SOL and again down to sort of that 160 area 159 um and BTC looks pretty even.</p>
  <h3>Key Levels</h3><table style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;margin-top:.5rem">
        <thead><tr><th>Asset</th><th>Level</th><th>Role</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody><tr><td></td><td>205</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>206</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>110</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>120</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody>
      </table>
  <h3>Setups</h3><p style="color:#9aa3b2">No explicit setups.</p>
  <h3>Takeaways</h3><ul><li>Um, I got dragged out for a, uh, uh, a surprise birthday party last night and, uh, I am feeling very much worse for wear, but uh, you probably hear my voice is a little bit gone, but um, we'll get through this.</li><li>Um there's obviously been that huge spike up overnight uh which has taken out uh quite a bit of long liquidity and we've still sort of got that little area there on SOL up to about 205 206.</li><li>And once they're full, um, sort of once between this 116 area and this sort of 111 area, once that starts to get quite dense in there, then you run the risk of them going, &quot;Cool.&quot; It's easy just to shoot down now and just drive through that to actually hit the stuff that they might have actually not got this time, but may still have the intentions to go back and get.</li><li>Um, so we might see a bit of a pullback in um, altcoins and uh, but overall really good place to be if we want to see an alt season and we've come all the way back through basically everything on the total.</li></ul>
  
  <h3>Notable Details</h3>
  <ul><li>Um, welcome to your, uh, BTC SOL.</li><li>Um, and BTC never never actually got down to that 110 level.</li><li>Um, it looks like it bounced off uh a 6 day um range support, which I'll show you in the chart soon.</li><li>Um, I'm not liking what I'm seeing on BTC.</li><li>So uh so there's your one day um 7-day liquidity.</li><li>Um looking pretty even on BTC. a good reason to both swipe the top and swipe the bottom which kind of lines up with um what we'll see in these closes.</li></ul>
