  <h3>TL;DR</h3><ul><li>So don't know if I like that confluence, but um hey, if it happens, it could end up being one of the best shorts um that you're going to see.</li><li>Like it it could just pull up pull up just a little bit and then be in a position of strength, pull down just a little bit, be in a position of, you know, um…</li><li>And yeah, if this goes back to 68% that's another one of those big nasty alt dumps that you're going to see like like when you had that um spike up there. it…</li></ul>
  <h3>Context</h3><p>And yeah, if this goes back to 68% that's another one of those big nasty alt dumps that you're going to see like like when you had that um spike up there. it wouldn't necessarily be as bad because that spike was a bigger spike, but we don't know what this will actually do, you know?</p>
  <h3>Key Levels</h3><table style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;margin-top:.5rem">
        <thead><tr><th>Asset</th><th>Level</th><th>Role</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody><tr><td></td><td>114</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>109</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>123</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>214</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody>
      </table>
  <h3>Setups</h3><p style="color:#9aa3b2">No explicit setups.</p>
  <h3>Takeaways</h3><ul><li>There'SA ton of different time frames and some of the really big ones are are pointing right up to the sky and um unfortunately some of the other ones are potentially setting up for a um a sweep of the lows.</li><li>So, if it was to go all the way up there, I guess you're assuming that um heading up to 214, so many people would jump in to chase it that maybe they then hit the hold level and then dump and just uh don't stop.</li><li>So, it doesn't tell us whether it's going to be a break to the top or a break to the bottom at this stage, but if it was to come down a little bit further and just close under the trend, then that would signal more more of a chance of it breaking down.</li><li>So, this is one of those little weird gaps that um yeah, if it does come down close under that trend, then you'd probably see a drop uh down to that body, which would have confluence with the the next ladder or the next layer of the trend.</li></ul>
  
  <h3>Notable Details</h3>
  <ul><li>Hey everyone, welcome to your daily update for SOL and BTC.</li><li>So, like to be fair, the the one day isn't really telling us all that much other than it might go and try and hit that 114 area.</li><li>And downside wise, um, they could easily go down and hit that 109.</li><li>With SOL, the there's definitely more to the upside to take.</li><li>And one of the hold levels today that potentially could send price to um that 123 area uh is about 214.</li><li>And it's just interesting the one day liquidity sort of just goes all the way up to about 214.</li></ul>
