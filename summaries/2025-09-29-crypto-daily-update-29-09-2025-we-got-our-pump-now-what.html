  <h3>TL;DR</h3><ul><li>Um but um so when we look at these charts uh soon it is also looking like we're basically just seeing one really big deviation of trend and it it was quite c…</li><li>You know, we might just go back up there and have another rejection um around that 226. the uh and the bottom end of of the liquidity is you know all the way…</li><li>So is 104 for that matter, you know, but really if they went down and hit 107, they've taken just about everything uh on BTC that's in that 30-day realm and …</li></ul>
  <h3>Context</h3><p>You know, we might just go back up there and have another rejection um around that 226. the uh and the bottom end of of the liquidity is you know all the way down in the 180s but uh the big spike area is around that 200 where you know a lot of people stop losses will be sitting who have started to bring in longs as the price has been pumping uh for the BTC side of it then it still says we can go down to 105 106 um but the bulk of it is 107 and um anything sort of up to about that 116 area again starting to look a little bit too much um like the longs are starting to take over a bit too much uh on BTC but SOL's still pretty even if we go to the 30-day 30-day actually doesn't look that out of balance which does imply that they might just keep pushing up for a bit um yeah or they could go down and give shorts some hope um thing thing about shorts is once you've got them trapped It's just it's just, you know, um an infinite means of generating money or bankruptcy because people can just keep on covering a short until eventually they they have nothing left in their account.</p>
  <h3>Key Levels</h3><table style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;margin-top:.5rem">
        <thead><tr><th>Asset</th><th>Level</th><th>Role</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody><tr><td></td><td>115</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>219</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>197</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>198</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>221</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>223</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody>
      </table>
  <h3>Setups</h3><p style="color:#9aa3b2">No explicit setups.</p>
  <h3>Takeaways</h3><ul><li>So, um, looking at the liquidity on SOL, uh, everything sort of up to about one, uh, sorry, I get it right, 219 is up for grabs.</li><li>So it's um yeah there's there is this thing called zero if you go down and and basically try to wipe out longs.</li><li>And uh yeah, SOL it's still really the 180s um at the lowest and around that 231 at the top side.</li><li>It's um it would be probably good to close up just purely because then you've hard closed the um the monthly break level.</li></ul>
  
  <h3>Notable Details</h3>
  <ul><li>So look looking at liquidity uh 116k to the upside you or 115.</li><li>It's kind of got a couple of clusters there uh on BTC and we still got clusters to the downside.</li><li>Um, and anything sort of down to about that 197 198 is still in play.</li><li>So if we dial it up and look at the 7day, 7day is anything up to about that 221 223 sort of number.</li><li>Yes, there are 105ers on the chart.</li><li>231 is actually the target for the daily trend break.</li></ul>
