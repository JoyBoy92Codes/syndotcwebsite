  <h3>TL;DR</h3><ul><li>But uh uh outside of that, uh we are on a weekend and um you can tell looking at the um uh one day liquidity charts on Bitcoin there, it's become its lovely …</li><li>It's going to be able to push up and push down um or down and up, but it's going to live in this little area here until it can actually break out of that eit…</li><li>Um, it's still in the bigger picture trying to work its way up to test uh these hold levels up uh up towards this 200 or 20308 area um or 2015 area, but it's…</li></ul>
  <h3>Context</h3><p>Um, it's still in the bigger picture trying to work its way up to test uh these hold levels up uh up towards this 200 or 20308 area um or 2015 area, but it's clear they do not want it to go there yet.</p>
  <h3>Key Levels</h3><table style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;margin-top:.5rem">
        <thead><tr><th>Asset</th><th>Level</th><th>Role</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody><tr><td></td><td>127</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>114</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>238</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>224</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>228.5</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody>
      </table>
  <h3>Setups</h3><p style="color:#9aa3b2">No explicit setups.</p>
  <h3>Takeaways</h3><ul><li>If you look at the lower time frame liquidity charts, there's plenty to grab up to 127 and uh 114 has become the new low time frame base. um for BTC.</li><li>But when we get towards the end of this I'll show you some of the um other stuff that me and uh a couple others are working on which um will all become things in the future which will hopefully help you get better entries and know how price is moving around.</li><li>Um there's another there's another sort of opposite level to that at about 2 to8.5 which we're about to hit uh probably very shortly and then it will just come down to whether or not it closes over the top of that and then moves into the next the next sort of sub range up.</li><li>But then if you look at Bitcoin, you would say, well, no, they're not off the table because unless there'SA really big structural shift in the strength of um Bitcoin and SOL, then, you know, Bitcoin's got so much to grab to the downside, it just seems a little bit weird that it wouldn't go and get it.</li></ul>
  
  <h3>Notable Details</h3>
  <ul><li>Hey everyone, welcome to your daily update for SOL and BTC.</li><li>Um SOL.</li><li>So, down to those sort of 200s.</li><li>We already sort of had a bit of a pullback in SOL which um uh you know being a prime day there aren't too many daily closes to show you.</li><li>Uh so this liquidity map here for SOL, we still haven't gone and hit that daily um front side hold yet at 238 and we really really should.</li><li>Um the the sweep we've had down to uh that 224 area was pretty much down to a 1 hour origin level and then it's bounced off that.</li></ul>
