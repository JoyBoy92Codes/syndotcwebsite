  <h3>TL;DR</h3><ul><li>Um if we go to the 7-day, you know, same thing pretty much on SOL even playing field up or down. uh BTC a little bit more of a bias to to take um shorts, but…</li><li>You might it might come back down to that 107 area, maybe that 108 area um as a bit of a dip to take all that stuff to the bottom. uh and uh if suddenly Chin…</li><li>Um but so many people have chased this pump that there is all this lower time frame stuff and you know for BTC to get back to that higher time frame liquidit…</li></ul>
  <h3>Context</h3><p>Um if we go to the 7-day, you know, same thing pretty much on SOL even playing field up or down. uh BTC a little bit more of a bias to to take um shorts, but the thing is, you know, they're better off taking they're better off taking longs anyway um and letting shorts build confidence and then typically the way you see a short squeeze is it happens very quickly.</p>
  <h3>Key Levels</h3><table style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;margin-top:.5rem">
        <thead><tr><th>Asset</th><th>Level</th><th>Role</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody><tr><td></td><td>00</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>24</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>30</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>216</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>217</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody>

  <h3>Setups</h3><p style="color:#9aa3b2">No explicit setups.</p>
  <h3>Takeaways</h3><ul><li>Or you might think, oh, it's going up, but it's just, you know, a whole bunch um closing out shorts.</li><li>You know there's there'SA guy blue in the discord who you goes he said this um many many times all these shorts they can just keep going up and up and up and up and up until basically you know the the businesses are bankrupt.</li><li>Okay, if we look at the 30-day uh 30-day bit more bias to the upside in both cases, um you know, but if they were to do a swipe up, say SOL, you've got a pretty decent cluster there up to about that 216 217 area.</li><li>Um and it's if you've got them, it's and and they're in profit, you know, maybe just consider hedging them and um getting the liquidations, you know, much lower and seeing how it goes.</li></ul>
  
  <h3>Notable Details</h3>
  <ul><li>Hey everyone and welcome to your daily update for SOL and BTC.</li><li>So you sort of see that little bit of volatility that usually comes in around the um uh 8 8:00 p.m.</li><li>Um the the chop that we've sort of been going through in the last 24 hours has definitely created a pretty even playing field on SOL and BTC for uh for the one day.</li><li>And there is some um charts that are pointing at that at the moment on SOL.</li><li>And if they were to take the downside, you know, going back to the 180s on the 30-day there, they'd be taking quite a big chunk.</li><li>If they went down to the 170s, it's almost just it's almost getting to the point where there just isn't really much down there anymore on the on the 30-day.</li></ul>
