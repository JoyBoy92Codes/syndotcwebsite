  <h3>TL;DR</h3><ul><li>Uh we've got um heavy shorts, you know, when you when you look on on BTC, we've got heavy shorts if you look at 7-day positions and also quite a lot of short…</li><li>So, I'm thinking that uh and I'll show you in the charts the confluence of this later, but I'm thinking that we're going to see that sort of 170 to 175 range…</li><li>Uh, but it's going to open from a position unless it unless it does get back up over it would have to get back up over about 1 or 0.00145 and open on the oth…</li></ul>
  <h3>Context</h3><p>So, I'm thinking that uh and I'll show you in the charts the confluence of this later, but I'm thinking that we're going to see that sort of 170 to 175 range hit um on SOL and we may even make a decent liquidity sweep um certainly up to 117 in uh in BTC.</p>
  <h3>Key Levels</h3><table style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;margin-top:.5rem">
        <thead><tr><th>Asset</th><th>Level</th><th>Role</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody><tr><td></td><td>170</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>175</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>117</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>30</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>120</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>123</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody>
      </table>
  <h3>Setups</h3><p style="color:#9aa3b2">No explicit setups.</p>
  <h3>Takeaways</h3><ul><li>So, if they really want to make this hard, uh they'll they'll push this down. they they'll sell down the strength um prior to close, but as it stands right now, it looks like it's going to try and get over the inside of that interior and that would give it the ability to move a bit.</li><li>Um so, if we look at that on the 5day close today, uh there'SA range trend being developed and as long as the price doesn't go much lower, the new candle will open with support of the range trend and then it will be able to move.</li><li>Um, which which would be the the 5day trend in confluence with a retest of the break which caused the rejection in confluence with the new break um that will get developed uh just below that level.</li><li>Um, so one of the reasons why I think this could be a trap is um, if we hit that, we've already utilized our hold level down here.</li></ul>
  
  <h3>Notable Details</h3>
  <ul><li>Uh, welcome to today's update for BTC SOL Market Cap.</li><li>Um definitely more longs coming in um on both SOL and BTC.</li><li>So, that's based on 7-day liquidity.</li><li>30-day liquidity.</li><li>I mean, you could see BTC go and try to sweep everything that's up in that upper area in the in the 120 to 123 area.</li><li>Um so SOL isn't really doesn't really have that much sitting up above 175.</li></ul>
