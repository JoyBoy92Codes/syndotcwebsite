  <h3>TL;DR</h3><ul><li>Um the the reason that that might be a little bit tricky is is just because there will be other resistances um in play um like the backside of the 3-day tren…</li><li>So, as far as the longs, um if you'd longed the daily trend, um you down at 179, then the idea would be to um probably even take a little bit of profit now j…</li><li>And then certainly 184 um you'd want to take a little bit off the table and then um see how it goes from there. aiming up to 195 or up to 200 just to if it r…</li></ul>
  <h3>Context</h3><p>Um the the reason that that might be a little bit tricky is is just because there will be other resistances um in play um like the backside of the 3-day trend um which comes in and causes a bit of resistance um or the two-day hold which um is created up here.</p>
  <h3>Key Levels</h3><table style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;margin-top:.5rem">
        <thead><tr><th>Asset</th><th>Level</th><th>Role</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody><tr><td></td><td>179</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>181</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>184</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>186</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>195</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>205</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody>
      </table>
  <h3>Setups</h3><p style="color:#9aa3b2">No explicit setups.</p>
  <h3>Takeaways</h3><ul><li>Um so for SOL that uh that was down here um which coincided with it hitting the daily trend as well.</li><li>Um really the next step is to get a 5m minutee candle hard body closed over this origin and then and then it can use this um this constant level of resistance that runs across here to take the next step.</li><li>Once it gets up into that area, it's running into, you know, very high time frame resistance, etc. from a lot of those bigger trends that move today and um you really shouldn't be expecting it to go much higher than that um in the short term.</li><li>Um, take some off the table here at this resistance and then look up to the sort of 184 area uh vxtp and uh if it loses this level down here, it's it's probably just going to be, you know, that'SA great sign it's going lower.</li></ul>
  
  <h3>Notable Details</h3>
  <ul><li>Um just coming to you with 4hour update.</li><li>Uh not quite 4 hours yet, but much is going to change.</li><li>Um so the total market cap uh ran into its 5day support.</li><li>So So you see the engulfment here on a 5m minute.</li><li>So, it's only a small move at the end of the day from 179 up to 181 um.9 or thereabouts.</li><li>Um, it' be realistic at this point to to assume that they're trying to take some of that liquidity that sort of lives up to 184 um maybe 186.</li></ul>
