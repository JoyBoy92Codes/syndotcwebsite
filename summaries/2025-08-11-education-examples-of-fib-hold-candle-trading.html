  <h3>Context</h3><p>So therefore, if you're if you're starting out and you're not really great at finding trends um or identifying where they are, particularly because they can get very messy on lower time frames, um just taking a trade on the back side of a range with a fib is actually a very very very simple easy trade.</p>
  <h3>Key Levels</h3><table style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;margin-top:.5rem">
        <thead><tr><th>Asset</th><th>Level</th><th>Role</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody><tr><td></td><td>1618</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>234</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>241</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>218</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody>
      </table>
  <h3>Setups</h3><p style="color:#9aa3b2">No explicit setups.</p>
  <h3>Takeaways</h3><ul><li>You can't really make it out when you look at it on the daily, but as you can see there, it went down. uh didn't quite make it to the 0.5 and then it bounced back up and closed up over the um 1618.</li><li>Now in this particular one at the top here um there isn't really a very identifiable trend in here um because at that point there is only one yellow candle.</li><li>Um, if you're taking them on the front side of the range like that, you just need to be very careful that that you have studied and practice how how trends affect candles um and effectively where the candle actually opens compared to where the trend is.</li><li>Um not only did it move from the 218 to the 221 which is the fib move itself but effectively what hold levels are designed to do is they are designed to attack trends and because our trend was so far up here you can see it actually went from there all the way back to there.</li></ul>
  
  <h3>Notable Details</h3>
  <ul><li>Um, so when the price comes back into this area, we're looking at getting an entry somewhere below the one and we want to run it back up to the 1618.</li><li>So up here on a daily that to a 1 hour.</li><li>You're looking at getting an entry anywhere below the one and you're looking at taking your profits um at the 1618.</li><li>So that was 234 up to 241.</li><li>So, so that so there is um fib trading is effectively the same as trading holds to trends except the way price seems to get structured on a chart is that about 94 odd% of the time the trend will never ever be within the distance of the 1618.</li><li>Um once you get a little bit more advanced and and you know that hey, I can identify a trend, I'm really sure of that. uh then what you are doing is you're taking your entry below 218 and then you're tping when it touches the trend at 234.</li></ul>
