  <h3>TL;DR</h3><ul><li>Um but it's it's looking like it's trying to build the structure to um break the support trends and have some form of continuation.</li><li>So it's um uh yeah it's it's due for it and it's distributing and it's on the trend.</li><li>Now it may bounce off that and give a temporary sort of push but um yeah it's it's still got that resistance up here in the 200s.</li></ul>
  <h3>Context</h3><p>So it's um uh yeah it's it's due for it and it's distributing and it's on the trend.</p>
  <h3>Key Levels</h3><table style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;margin-top:.5rem">
        <thead><tr><th>Asset</th><th>Level</th><th>Role</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody><tr><td></td><td>150</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>10</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>168</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>170</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>15</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody>
      </table>
  <h3>Setups</h3><p style="color:#9aa3b2">No explicit setups.</p>
  <h3>Takeaways</h3><ul><li>Um, SOL is looking, as far as its strength goes, it's looking to close in a position capable of breaking its 3-day uptrend against um against Bitcoin.</li><li>So, we've been ping ponging up and down inside here, which is kind of why um alts have been uh strong, weak, strong, weak, you know, um basically stuck between two different range trends.</li><li>It's one of the biggest levels that SOL actually has. um sort of got to be around for a few years before you're even going to have a level like that.</li><li>Um so you know some of these levels that it's um rejected in the past or once it got over the top of it how it created that lovely bounce.</li></ul>
  
  <h3>Notable Details</h3>
  <ul><li>Um just a daily update on the closures we have today for SOL and uh Bitcoin and total market cap.</li><li>Um, as far as where things are sitting, so the 2-day is still in rejection, uh, it looks like it might close and create a hold level, which means it can try and break this trend.</li><li>Um we're creating a distribution range on the 3-day today.</li><li>So you know 1 2 3 4 5.</li><li>Um the 5day is literally sandwiched between two range breaks.</li><li>And again, it could it could it could technically bounce up down uh more confluence in that 150 area.</li></ul>
