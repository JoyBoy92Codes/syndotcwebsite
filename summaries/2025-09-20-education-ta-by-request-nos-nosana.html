  <h3>TL;DR</h3><ul><li>So, so to be absolutely realistic, um the token kind of lives in this area at the moment and you know if it if it was to push up abovexum cuz it's it has…</li><li>Yeah, it's it's not um hasn't really been through that much accumulation down here um at this price point.</li><li>Um if you've if you've got a position that's all the way up here in that xyou know, xorxprice point, then there'SA lot of things this has to get throu…</li></ul>
  <h3>Context</h3><p>So, so to be absolutely realistic, um the token kind of lives in this area at the moment and you know if it if it was to push up abovexum cuz it's it has just recently tested this break level and it hasn't uh yeah so it's it's retested the break level and it's also retested the trend and if it closes up for the month then because these levels are kind of tested, it could go and retest thatxor umxarea.</p>
  <h3>Key Levels</h3><table style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;margin-top:.5rem">
        <thead><tr><th>Asset</th><th>Level</th><th>Role</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody><tr><td></td><td>x</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>x</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>x</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>x</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>x</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>x</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody>
      </table>
  <h3>Setups</h3><p style="color:#9aa3b2">No explicit setups.</p>
  <h3>Takeaways</h3><ul><li>And the other option of course is that um the bearish option is pretty much that it uh it opens below this trend, rejects off the back side of the trend again and goes down to create a hold level.</li><li>II'd say if I was to take a scalp on this, and it would only be a scalp, I don't think I would um don't think I would be expecting this to get past these dollar sort of levels.</li><li>So, you know, there might be a move in here if you're not already a bag holder. um you could get ax move off that hold level back to the trend.</li><li>Um but yeah, it doesn't look doesn't look totally positive in the scheme of things and it also doesn't really have any kind of range trends on a high time frame.</li></ul>
  
  <h3>Notable Details</h3>
  <ul><li>So first impressions are huge amount of accumulationxtox.</li><li>Uh obviously something got shield um massivex pump to the upside.</li><li>They probably all SOL into everybody buying as as the price shot up.</li><li>Then the other half of your position, you could look to TP up here at about ax move.</li><li>If it does hard close back inside that topside range, uh which is more or less getting up and closing a month into thatxarea again.</li><li>If it does that, then you could start to have that dream of the of the um xrange again, but or xrange.</li></ul>
