  <h3>TL;DR</h3><ul><li>Um and yesterday was a prime exchange day which um so it's also been doing a lot of research around trying to figure out what these uh universal anchor dates…</li><li>So, yeah, it's just uh maybe this becomes the hated part of the rally where they leave all this stuff behind and just go up. and they might be leaving the um…</li><li>Um, now unfortunately, this level that's up here, well, it's the same thing but in reverse, it got swept, it came back down, and this candle that we're in ri…</li></ul>
  <h3>Context</h3><p>Um and yesterday was a prime exchange day which um so it's also been doing a lot of research around trying to figure out what these uh universal anchor dates are for the various time frames that exchange use which which differ from trading view and um managed to find some common dates that actually uh cross over with you know weeklies and multi days and based on that information uh yesterday was was the day of the flush even though it was a pretty weak little flush.</p>
  <h3>Key Levels</h3><table style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;margin-top:.5rem">
        <thead><tr><th>Asset</th><th>Level</th><th>Role</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody><tr><td></td><td>216</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>213</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>212</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>232</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>238</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody>
      </table>
  <h3>Setups</h3><p style="color:#9aa3b2">No explicit setups.</p>
  <h3>Takeaways</h3><ul><li>So, um, we may be in for just another little repeat flush, but I guess we'll see what the charts are saying, whether that agrees. um looking at the 7-day liquidity, then there'SA lot more to the upside on SOL.</li><li>And that could be why that they've just gone, h no, let's let's go and let's go and um take some of this because things like 238 have been our daily target ever since a trend break, you know, a couple weeks ago.</li><li>Uh, so it just seems a little odd that we had such a tiny pullback um when there was so much liquidity just, you know, within, you know, really, really close proximity to where they chose to stop.</li><li>So typ typically um new short-term liquidity enters the market uh at the beginning of major market opens, but this sort of came in about an hour after um New Yorker closed.</li></ul>
  
  <h3>Notable Details</h3>
  <ul><li>Hi everyone, welcome to your update for SOL and BTC.</li><li>Uh, we ended up bouncing on SOL off the weekly trend um to the scent.</li><li>And in the scheme of a weekly move at uh you know pushing down from which was about the weekly trend and then pushing down to something like 216 or 213 or 212 or just any of those levels that were really really close.</li><li>So, yeah, pushing up to that 232 level was always an option.</li><li>So, we should still get to that 238 level eventually.</li><li>And uh but yeah, I really would have thought that would have taken at least down to that 216.</li></ul>
