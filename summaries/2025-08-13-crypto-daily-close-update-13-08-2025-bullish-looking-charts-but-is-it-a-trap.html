  <h3>TL;DR</h3><ul><li>So if they're trying to induce people to open longs by looking super bullish, um it's quite cheap to do it at the moment. they can just keep bidding it up, b…</li><li>Um but at the moment they're still pushing up into that higher liquidity which sort of ranges up to about 124k or on um SOL sort of ranges up to about um 206…</li><li>Um yeah, if they are going to sweep that lower liquidity, you'll probably find that that just pulls back up in the next 50 odd minutes and closes above. uh a…</li></ul>
  <h3>Context</h3><p>Um yeah, if they are going to sweep that lower liquidity, you'll probably find that that just pulls back up in the next 50 odd minutes and closes above. uh and it's sort of implying that when you when you view it from a lower time frame perspective, you can see the range trend is coming through here at about 65.2 and at the moment it's just kind of bouncing off the top of that if as if it's trying to tell us, you know, the future is not certain for downside.</p>
  <h3>Key Levels</h3><table style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;margin-top:.5rem">
        <thead><tr><th>Asset</th><th>Level</th><th>Role</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody><tr><td></td><td>205</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>114</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>206</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>207</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>209</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody>
      </table>
  <h3>Setups</h3><p style="color:#9aa3b2">No explicit setups.</p>
  <h3>Takeaways</h3><ul><li>So maybe that implies that the next dump won't be quite as bad, but it um still on the 7day you you'd really just want to take everything down into those 180s, 182s. um on Bitcoin, you'd sort of want to take everything down to about 114 again um on the 7day.</li><li>Um so for for Bitcoin um it's showing sort of around that 125 124 125 if they were to spike it up to the upside but on the from a 30-day perspective it's heavily piled to the downside.</li><li>So um you know 110 is still there as that magic number um on Bitcoin and uh so unless we are going off now on that final blowoff top um they're going to grab some of this liquidity just when everyone sort of feels like it's never going to go back it'll go back.</li><li>Um so SOL BTC uh it it closed up um over that trend line on the one day yesterday and it's pushed up into the the whole candle.</li></ul>
  
  <h3>Notable Details</h3>
  <ul><li>Um, bringing you your market update for BTC SOL, uh, market cap, liquidity, all that kind of stuff.</li><li>SOL's been pushing up and up and up.</li><li>Um I tpd my SOL long at 205 and just kind of watching to see what happens with the daily close.</li><li>So people are trying to short this um on SOL.</li><li>We had those targets that were there at 205 anyway.</li><li>So we look at 7-day um piles to the downside, not so much to the upside.</li></ul>
