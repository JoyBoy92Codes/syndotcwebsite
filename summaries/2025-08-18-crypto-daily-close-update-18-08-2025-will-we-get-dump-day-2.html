  <h3>TL;DR</h3><ul><li>There is deeper than that, you know, available on some bigger time frames, but um particularly people who entered on the monthly um trades um a while ago and…</li><li>Uh it is a daily level and we do have a couple hours left. um if they want to induce more shorts then I guess staying flat for now is not such a bad thing bu…</li><li>And that's giving um that's what's giving us basically this little bit of a bounce back on things like SOL where we've bounced off those um uh 179 levels.</li></ul>
  <h3>Context</h3><p>Uh it is a daily level and we do have a couple hours left. um if they want to induce more shorts then I guess staying flat for now is not such a bad thing but you can see it's looking like it's going to poke up and grab that 100x liquidity now um from the higher time frame there's still a ton as you can see to the downside so you know BTC goes this numbers down to 102 96 98 SOL um really little to the upside there on the high time frame so if you really want to take upside liquidity, it's more or less got to go and hit 210 um or higher.</p>
  <h3>Key Levels</h3><table style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;margin-top:.5rem">
        <thead><tr><th>Asset</th><th>Level</th><th>Role</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody><tr><td></td><td>24</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>115</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>170</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>202</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>112</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>120</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody>
      </table>
  <h3>Setups</h3><p style="color:#9aa3b2">No explicit setups.</p>
  <h3>Takeaways</h3><ul><li>Um, so if we look at the 7-day liquidity, uh, 7-day liquidity, uh, more bearish positions, so more shorts open, um, which makes a bit of sense.</li><li>Um, so 7day uh liquidity is down to sort of like 170 on SOL up to about um 202.</li><li>Uh so BTC came down and it um landed uh into that 115 area and then they had to spend all this time down there so that people would enter shorts and then that gave them the liquidity to push up. um to that target which was about uh 1165.</li><li>Um and then we move into things like unemployment claims and um housing sales, you know, and there's always a lot of financial talk at um Jackson Hole as well.</li></ul>
  
  <h3>Notable Details</h3>
  <ul><li>Uh welcome to your daily update for SOL BTC and all these other bits and pieces.</li><li>Uh on the one day the the action we've had in sort of the last 24 hours with the dumping and the sideways and then the little pumps and all that kind of stuff has kind of got people um clearly confused.</li><li>Um, BTC, interestingly enough, people still seem to be a little bit more bullish on it at the moment, probably because they think it's holding that 115 level uh really well.</li><li>Uh going down to about uh 112 113K if they swipe the bottom on BTC and then sort of up to about 120 would take most of it.</li><li>Um, we look at the 30-day liquidity.</li><li>30-day liquidity would be regarded as slightly bullish for for BTC, but again, giving them the opportunity to pump down or dump down, I should say, to 110.</li></ul>
