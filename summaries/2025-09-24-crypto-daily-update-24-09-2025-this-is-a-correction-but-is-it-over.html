  <h3>TL;DR</h3><ul><li>Now it's um yeah whether they even bother to go up and take you know when when you look at this balance do they even bother going up to take 114 before they …</li><li>Um we've sort of been held under a dominance uh down sorry, we've been held under a market cap downtrend. um which really is just means that everything's in …</li><li>Um but you know that rejection could you know reverse and then it can travel up and down because effectively it's it'SA weekly or a daily level rejection so …</li></ul>
  <h3>Context</h3><p>Now it's um yeah whether they even bother to go up and take you know when when you look at this balance do they even bother going up to take 114 before they bother to you know before they go down and take 105 don't know and you know if we do go down to 105 do they come back quickly or do they hang around there and everyone buys the dip and then do they go to 102 and you know that's kind of the the that's the difference really between a correction and a sustained downtrend and a liquidity grab.</p>
  <h3>Key Levels</h3><table style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;margin-top:.5rem">
        <thead><tr><th>Asset</th><th>Level</th><th>Role</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody><tr><td></td><td>2021</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>109</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>110</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>114</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>115</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody>
      </table>
  <h3>Setups</h3><p style="color:#9aa3b2">No explicit setups.</p>
  <h3>Takeaways</h3><ul><li>Um and as far as SOL goes, it's sort of showing liquidity up there at about 217, but this entire move so far, we have not gone back to resistance um as you typically would.</li><li>Uh unfortunately um if we look at 7 days uh 7-day liquidity pretty much lining up the same and it's the first time frame where it shows a little bit more of a reason to go up.</li><li>Um but it's still not really showing a lot of a reason to go past the sort of um 220s or you know 230 at this stage.</li><li>So if we get up to these levels, we may get SOL out of um that 116, sorry, 116, 216. um area that it's sort of trapped under or has been trapped under.</li></ul>
  
  <h3>Notable Details</h3>
  <ul><li>Hey everyone, uh welcome to your daily update for SOL and BTC.</li><li>And as you can see from the the 1day liquidity chart, it's it's already now stacked more to the downside than it is to the upside.</li><li>And this is pretty much what the 2021 top looked like.</li><li>So, as far as uh the levels, um one day on BTC, you know, could easily go down and retest the the 109 110 area.</li><li>It's still not really finding a reason to go above 114 115.</li><li>And we have rejection um hold levels in that 115 area that could potentially send us down to 105.</li></ul>
