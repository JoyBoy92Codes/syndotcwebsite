  <h3>TL;DR</h3><ul><li>So we had the bounce off the daily rejection down to the 1618 target which was um uh entering this candle here at 189.526 and then rejecting um back down to …</li><li>Um, and I'm sort of looking for the deepest entry down there at about 176. uh if we do continue to go up um the break level on the daily was the next target …</li><li>Um, so with BTC sitting all really close to all this 100x liquidity that it it probably will take um whether it tries to fake people out by going up a little…</li></ul>
  <h3>Context</h3><p>So we had the bounce off the daily rejection down to the 1618 target which was um uh entering this candle here at 189.526 and then rejecting um back down to uh the target which was 18 sorry 189.526 and then we rejected down to the 185 um 627.</p>
  <h3>Key Levels</h3><table style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;margin-top:.5rem">
        <thead><tr><th>Asset</th><th>Level</th><th>Role</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>

  <h3>Setups</h3><p style="color:#9aa3b2">No explicit setups.</p>
  <h3>Takeaways</h3><ul><li>Um the 5day move uh closed within its break level but um it looks ultimately like it's probably going to go down.</li><li>So, it wouldn't surprise me if we reject off that trend and then we come down to sort of these 180s or um, uh, sorry, 182 level, which would be a daily level.</li><li>Um, but with BTC looking like it really wants to come down, I'll just um over the liquidity.</li><li>They've they've had their positions open a bit longer and they've been left alone, but um that'll that'll start to come on the radar now.</li></ul>
  
  <h3>Notable Details</h3>
  <ul><li>Um some uh interesting closes today on BTC in particular.</li><li>Uh we do have a little bit of support or a bounce that's been going on um based on the 3-day.</li><li>Uh but the ones that were interesting were more like um a 4day which closed below trend and the trend shifted there.</li><li>Um we've got rejections to play out on the 7day.</li><li>Uh we've got the 8day.</li><li>So the 8day um we had a drop straight after daily close, but they didn't go up and trigger the rejection.</li></ul>
