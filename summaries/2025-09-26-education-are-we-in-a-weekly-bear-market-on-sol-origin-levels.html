  <h3>TL;DR</h3><ul><li>So, it's not it's not a very clean origin level and it's got that silly little silly little dogee in there.</li><li>And the other one, which would be this level, and like I said, it's very, very dirty dirty level, this one, because it's got these candles above it, but they…</li><li>I think overall what's happening is we're compressing into this area on the weekly and we're going to either come out over the top of this or maybe even up o…</li></ul>
  <h3>Context</h3><p>I think overall what's happening is we're compressing into this area on the weekly and we're going to either come out over the top of this or maybe even up over the top of this or we're going to end up under this in which case we're going to have to go to this.</p>
  <h3>Key Levels</h3><table style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;margin-top:.5rem">
        <thead><tr><th>Asset</th><th>Level</th><th>Role</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody><tr><td></td><td>2021</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>204</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>636</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>256</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>914</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody>
      </table>
  <h3>Setups</h3><p style="color:#9aa3b2">No explicit setups.</p>
  <h3>Takeaways</h3><ul><li>Um just uh discussing in the Discord um a video that's come out from a very good trader uh saying that basically it's over and it'SA bare market and all that kind of stuff.</li><li>And the target for that level would just be to come back up to this level unless there's something else.</li><li>Okay, it's pretty dirty because it's gone all the way through it and come back down, but a candle above it.</li><li>So, hypothetically, if that dogee an indecision candle, if there was one more little voting order in there that kind of implies that it's part of this range, then maybe this 256 914 becomes a bit of a gamecher because that would be a level the same as all these other levels in the past that gives a huge rejection unless it gets closed over.</li></ul>
  
  <h3>Notable Details</h3>
  <ul><li>So I thought I might have a look at SOL and just see you know are there any obvious lines on the higher time frame or anything that could kind of give us an idea about it.</li><li>2021, right?</li><li>So, so now broadly speaking, this is the range that SOL exists in.</li><li>So, this is also a 2021 level.</li><li>So, if we close the week over 204 636, then we are still in weekly support.</li><li>And of course, a close over the 253.428 428 level would also lead to all-time highs because it's no different than when we closed over these levels down here.</li></ul>
