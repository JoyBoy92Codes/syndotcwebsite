  <h3>TL;DR</h3><ul><li>So so for this trend here is sticky because it's kind of like the same thing as trying to break this range here. um which you know it's tried to do that befo…</li><li>And um those two would then have a bit of choppy fight, you know, um pretty big choppy fight like a it's going to be like a $24 choppy fight as it goes up an…</li><li>Um but as you can see it's at that trend now and it's it's not really it's not running away, you know, like it's not disappearing off like it did the last ti…</li></ul>
  <h3>Context</h3><p>So so for this trend here is sticky because it's kind of like the same thing as trying to break this range here. um which you know it's tried to do that before and it's never really been able to do that but but it's it's having another go at it.</p>
  <h3>Key Levels</h3><table style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;margin-top:.5rem">
        <thead><tr><th>Asset</th><th>Level</th><th>Role</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody><tr><td></td><td>179</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>19</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>180</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>2021</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody>
      </table>
  <h3>Setups</h3><p style="color:#9aa3b2">No explicit setups.</p>
  <h3>Takeaways</h3><ul><li>Um also what that could mean for tomorrow because when that candle closes it'SA break of the interior normal trend um and it will shift the interior normal trend to there.</li><li>So if they close up here somewhere above um uh above this trend tomorrow, then this would be your most I say bullish because the advantage to us is that we could then get buy prices all the way down here and run them all the way up to there.</li><li>So, the reason this is not great, like not what I really want to see, is because I can't open a position um with as much risk and as much size if it bounces here and starts heading this way because there is the possibility it rolls over, comes back down here, then goes and that'SA real trap for longs.</li><li>Um that's where you sort of get cuz you've got things like these low lower time frame daily levels etc sort of up in here.</li></ul>
  
  <h3>Notable Details</h3>
  <ul><li>Um just coming through with a 4hour update on SOL trade.</li><li>Uh so it's it seems to be going up to those liquidity areas that um we thought in the 180s.</li><li>Um it got really really sticky around 179 and and it was yesterday as well.</li><li>Um, we know it closes in 19 hours.</li><li>That's um gives us a bit of higher time frame meaning to why we're sort of stuck around this 179 180 area.</li><li>So our target may actually then become that which is the which is the 2021 origin.</li></ul>
