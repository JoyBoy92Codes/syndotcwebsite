  <h3>TL;DR</h3><ul><li>You 117 we we hit that on um we actually hit that 1172 number that structural um hold level on BTC that we talked about uh yesterday and that's rejected off …</li><li>Um so, you know, I we are going to get a hold level and that could um that could either mean that price comes back a bit first or strength comes back a bit f…</li><li>Um, so really, we're just watching to see whether it closes below the trend. uh which you know is anywhere up to about 20592 and um and if it's got a wick on…</li></ul>
  <h3>Context</h3><p>Um, so really, we're just watching to see whether it closes below the trend. uh which you know is anywhere up to about 20592 and um and if it's got a wick on the top side like this uh then it's going to create a secondary which is basically like the third level now third third uh interior second interior third trend overall to the downside and then um you may get a little bit of a bounce when it hits uh 20452 and but it's not a full established range.</p>
  <h3>Key Levels</h3><table style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;margin-top:.5rem">
        <thead><tr><th>Asset</th><th>Level</th><th>Role</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody><tr><td></td><td>30</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>117</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>1172</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>119</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>120</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody>
      </table>
  <h3>Setups</h3><p style="color:#9aa3b2">No explicit setups.</p>
  <h3>Takeaways</h3><ul><li>Uh it's going to be a fun one this one because we've just uh had our uh US federal funds rate um and FOMC statement, the uh the media statement.</li><li>So, uh, we're seeing a bit of up and down and people sort of positioning and, um, all that kind of stuff, but at the moment, I'd say pretty much it'SA nothing burger and, uh, main focus is just focus on whatever structure does.</li><li>I think overall people assume that, you know, because we've had these rate cuts that um everything's going to go up, which might mean there'SA more of a risk of actually a downside move first, but guess we'll see how that plays out.</li><li>So, you know, it's really um, if they are pushing up, it's possibly just to bring in more longs before pushing down.</li></ul>
  
  <h3>Notable Details</h3>
  <ul><li>Hey everyone, welcome to your daily update for BTC and SOL.</li><li>And just quickly looking through them, the 1 day, the 7-day, and the 30-day all seem to well, actually the one the one day, probably the one day and the 7day might favor a little bit of a push up before some kind of sweep down.</li><li>There is an absolute ton um as mentioned yesterday, there is an absolute ton of hold levels formed between 117 and 119 120.</li><li>But um you know might just maybe they do just want to keep BTC sideways for a bit more.</li><li>Um you know, down to that sort of like one uh 112 area probably in the more short term.</li><li>There is AA 10day close today, which looks like it could be a really good trap um for for longs both on um BTC and on SOL.</li></ul>
