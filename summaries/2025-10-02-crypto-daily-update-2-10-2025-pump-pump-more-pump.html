  <h3>TL;DR</h3><ul><li>Uh but if it does go for a dive um it'll be back down to that sort of 200 area that you maybe as low as the 180s 190s but it's um at this stage it's looking …</li><li>If we do have a dip and that dip doesn't get you out, you you're going to want to you're going to want to be looking for a plan B because, you know, there's …</li><li>Uh but it's yeah at this stage looking very bullish. um if they want to mess with everybody, what they're going to do is they're just going to start probably…</li></ul>
  <h3>Context</h3><p>Uh but it's yeah at this stage looking very bullish. um if they want to mess with everybody, what they're going to do is they're just going to start probably around now um around a couple hours before close and they're just going to start to slowly draw this candle back down under the res under the resistance and then you know reject off the resistance and um go lower.</p>
  <h3>Key Levels</h3><table style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;margin-top:.5rem">
        <thead><tr><th>Asset</th><th>Level</th><th>Role</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody><tr><td></td><td>231</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>238</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>240</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>214</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>123</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody>
      </table>
  <h3>Setups</h3><p style="color:#9aa3b2">No explicit setups.</p>
  <h3>Takeaways</h3><ul><li>Uh all the liquidity is to the downside, all the way down to 106 um on BTC and all the way down to sort of like 199. uh upside targets haven't changed.</li><li>Um, however, you know, everything um, sitting down there, if they were to push it down to 218, you can see the short-term liquidity would easily allow them to cascade it down lower and take that high time frame liquidity that's sitting there at 200.</li><li>And you can see it's so bullish that it's probably going to open the next one on the top side of that trend unless something changes in the um and that breaks it out of that sort of downwards channel there if it does that.</li><li>Um most of the backside trend breaks we've had thus far have been very weak. they just haven't rejected heavily and uh that kind of shows the market's quite um uh quite bullish.</li></ul>
  
  <h3>Notable Details</h3>
  <ul><li>Hey everybody, uh welcome to your daily update for Solomon BTC.</li><li>So firstly, we we have not hit the daily front side target yet on um SOL.</li><li>The the backside hold level is at 231.</li><li>So that was our first target and the front side is sitting at 238.</li><li>And um the monthly trend has been pushed up to around 240 something.</li><li>But as far as where liquidity is currently sitting, uh the one day you can see it nicely goes up to 238.</li></ul>
