  <h3>TL;DR</h3><ul><li>Um just a little a little thing would be that we don't so say say for example we do not close over 208 for um the month but then next month we close over abo…</li><li>So it's um you at the moment if we come down here and we look bearish for a long time and then you get a wick up there then don't be surprised and same thing…</li><li>It's almost instantaneously when we closed the candle yesterday we started to rally and that allowed them to go up there and make people feel really bullish …</li></ul>
  <h3>Context</h3><p>It's almost instantaneously when we closed the candle yesterday we started to rally and that allowed them to go up there and make people feel really bullish and open up a whole bunch of longs cuz they think it's going to go to the moon. the influencers started posting super cycle videos and so on and so forth and then um you know hey guess what happens it it comes back down before the end of the day and that's that's how price action works when it comes to the psychology of it.</p>
  <h3>Key Levels</h3><table style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;margin-top:.5rem">
        <thead><tr><th>Asset</th><th>Level</th><th>Role</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody><tr><td></td><td>00</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>204</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>208</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>237</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>194</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody>
      </table>
  <h3>Setups</h3><p style="color:#9aa3b2">No explicit setups.</p>
  <h3>Takeaways</h3><ul><li>So um given that we've hit those upper levels but then retrace back down below really it comes down to today as to whether or not they push the price back up above the levels and and open the new uh the new candles across all the various time frames or whether or not they stay below the level in which case you might as well expect some more downside.</li><li>So looking at liquidity, it really could go either way, but it is more positioned to take the lower liquidity just because there's on things like SOL, there's this gap to the upside here where people aren't um filling filling up the space yet with new shorts on the daily.</li><li>So, that's probably going to take all of that um at some point in uh within, you know, next couple of days, I'd say. uh if it doesn't happen very very soon, maybe before you've even seen the video, just based on the way it's dropping.</li><li>Uh and yeah, we we've I guess you when it comes to these moves, you know, we we've got I was just showing in the Discord earlier today that we've got, you know, swing moves to 112 and we've got swing moves to, you know, um 214 and you don't really know which way it's going to go.</li></ul>
  
  <h3>Notable Details</h3>
  <ul><li>Hey everyone, welcome to your daily update for SOL BTC.</li><li>Their little algos uh went pretty mad trying to push the price down just before um 8:00 p.m. in uh UTC.</li><li>So yesterday the the core level really that we were looking for was that 204 level.</li><li>Um sweeping that level and completing some of the targets like the 5day target, stuff like that. they all got hit.</li><li>We still haven't hit that 208 level.</li><li>Uh there is a 5day um move in play down to this 194 level.</li></ul>
