  <h3>TL;DR</h3><ul><li>Um, and it is a possibility because sometimes what they'll do is they'll they'll hit a they'll hit a hold level or a resistance level say um at 210 or 211 uh…</li><li>If they've done that, they have activated everything right up to the 3-w week um levels, which is which is quite bullish to actually get that stuff out of th…</li><li>It's not manipulation, it's just what price does. if um if they pump everyone up over the weekend, induce a tonal longs, leave a couple of resistance levels …</li></ul>
  <h3>Context</h3><p>It's not manipulation, it's just what price does. if um if they pump everyone up over the weekend, induce a tonal longs, leave a couple of resistance levels that sort of exist there between um where the price is now and sort of where that 213 sort of price is, then we could just push up to this um and then have the dump and we would have 7 days to actually come back from that dump and close back up inside this channel and then if we did that we could bounce off that and head to that and then if we closed over that we could head to that.</p>
  <h3>Key Levels</h3><table style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;margin-top:.5rem">
        <thead><tr><th>Asset</th><th>Level</th><th>Role</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody><tr><td></td><td>212</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>216</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>16</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>213</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody>
      </table>
  <h3>Setups</h3><p style="color:#9aa3b2">No explicit setups.</p>
  <h3>Takeaways</h3><ul><li>Um thought I'd bring you another quick update uh SOL because it's pumping and it'SA weekend and I imagine um the real trend will probably become clear next week.</li><li>So, um, there is a way that they could close into those levels, create range trends, not have wicks on the top of the candles, open on the top side of the range trends, and just continue to move up, which would be insanely parabolic um, to do that kind of thing.</li><li>So like I say the the way in which they actually approach these levels actually creates their options for how they then um uh reject or potentially uh don't reject depending on exactly how they actually approach them.</li><li>Um so we've hit the 16-day level. um we've we're basically hugging the back of of the uh four-week trend on the way out.</li></ul>
  
  <h3>Notable Details</h3>
  <ul><li>So, um and BTC is basically just going sideways.</li><li>So, um it would be very bullish at this case uh at this time to actually go and take these higher levels between 212 and maybe even up to 216.</li><li>Um so we've hit the 16-day one there now.</li><li>And if they can keep the price up higher for about 4 days, then instead of that being a really big retracement, it might only lead to sort of the 190s um because the there'SA trend etc which may stop it.</li><li>Um, we've got the 2-day there at 212 and then we've got the 3-W week up there at 213.</li><li>And the 3-we and the 2-day close, I think, are both tomorrow.</li></ul>
