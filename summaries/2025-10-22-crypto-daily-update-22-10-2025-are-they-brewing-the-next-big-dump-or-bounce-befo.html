  <h3>TL;DR</h3><ul><li>Um, and it's it's got a bit of liquidity sort of building up um, just in this sort of 107 through to that kind of 109 area.</li><li>So So although it's got all of this leverage to to go and dive into to the downside, it's it's actually getting a reason to go up because people are actually…</li><li>But um yeah, you can't really expect the entire altcoin market to be uh going strong if this thing starts to move up. a retrace back to the level might be a …</li></ul>
  <h3>Context</h3><p>But um yeah, you can't really expect the entire altcoin market to be uh going strong if this thing starts to move up. a retrace back to the level might be a fake pump, you know, and that if you're in a long and you're looking at tping, then um you if this does do a pullback to the 66.72 level, that's, you know, sort of confluence with any of the other levels you're looking at on the particular token that you're trading, that would be a point to to definitely derisk and get rid of it.</p>
  <h3>Key Levels</h3><table style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;margin-top:.5rem">
        <thead><tr><th>Asset</th><th>Level</th><th>Role</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody><tr><td></td><td>24</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>107</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>109</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>170</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>183</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>30</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody>
      </table>
  <h3>Setups</h3><p style="color:#9aa3b2">No explicit setups.</p>
  <h3>Takeaways</h3><ul><li>So, one is there's either just something really big in play and and none of this really matters because it's it's all daily.</li><li>But the thing is if they keep the price down here for too long, then with nothing in between here, there will also be resistance levels that it's closing under, which means it may not even bother to go back up to there.</li><li>So, SOL BTC on the daily um pretty much it's been pushed down into support and it hasn't broken the downtrend because it's you not an accumulation candle.</li><li>So, at the moment, it's just basically a battle between someone who really wants SOL not to move up and the general structure that's created, which is where it should be trying to move up.</li></ul>
  
  <h3>Notable Details</h3>
  <ul><li>Hey everyone and welcome to your daily update for Solen BTC.</li><li>Uh we've had some pretty bearish sellowns yesterday just before close which has led to basically a 24-hour bleed.</li><li>So, um, there are actually, funnily enough, there there are quite a few people opening shorts on BTC.</li><li>So, this area is starting to fill up on BTC.</li><li>However, BTC still has more of a reason to go down anyway, so it's doesn't mean too much.</li><li>Um, SOL has landed on these 170 levels again.</li></ul>
