  <h3>TL;DR</h3><ul><li>Uh, there's, um, there is that small area that's starting to form uh, up around um, 210 to 213 that has confluence with some of the higher um, level rejectio…</li><li>Um and our monthly levels here at 102 and of course everything else in between um 116 uh is quite a key level there'SA lot of 100 100x leverage sitting there…</li><li>Either either way, the the strength that this is sort of showing given that it's rejected off the daily origin level, um the strength that it's showing reall…</li></ul>
  <h3>Context</h3><p>Um and our monthly levels here at 102 and of course everything else in between um 116 uh is quite a key level there'SA lot of 100 100x leverage sitting there but um yeah we'll get into the charts and I think you'll see that um based on sort of these more sort of higher time frames there's not a lot of reason to be traveling up but there'SA lot of liquidity to take to the downside right now um and where the clusters are to the upside side sort of say to me that if we spiked up and grab that.</p>
  <h3>Key Levels</h3><table style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;margin-top:.5rem">
        <thead><tr><th>Asset</th><th>Level</th><th>Role</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody><tr><td></td><td>198</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>186</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>183</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>182</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>115</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody>

  <h3>Setups</h3><p style="color:#9aa3b2">No explicit setups.</p>
  <h3>Takeaways</h3><ul><li>Um we seem to have all the volatility in the couple days leading up to the weekend and then after that it's just been UI suggest they're just trying to um replace the liquidity that was taken out of the market um in that pre-week volatility which um seem to be doing a pretty good job of.</li><li>Um, and there isn'TA lot of reason on the 7-day to go below 115 at this stage, but and overall you'd probably say SOL's pretty balanced um, as far as bulls and beers, but um, the BTC is looking kind of bearish on the 7day.</li><li>Um you've sort of got those grouped clusters heading all the way up to 212 213 um on SOL and then all the way down to sort of like the low uh 160s um to the downside.</li><li>That's all your 100 um 100x and then you've got um uh your 50x and then you got your 25x leverage.</li></ul>
  
  <h3>Notable Details</h3>
  <ul><li>Hey everyone, uh just bringing you your crypto update for today for SOL and BTC and Total Market Cap.</li><li>So looking at um liquidation levels uh on the one day um SOL has couple of clusters still hasn't really changed all that much.</li><li>So basically that sort of 198 to the upside through to sort of like the low 200s uh and the clusters to the downside is sort of around your uh 186 down to about your 183.</li><li>But um there is some levels uh on the charts daily levels at sort of 182.</li><li>So, I imagine they'd probably sweep a little bit lower than 183 if they if they went down on a short-term move.</li><li>Um, for BTC, uh, it's pretty even really 115 to the downside and 120 to the upside.</li></ul>
